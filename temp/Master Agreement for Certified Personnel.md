## CERTIFIED PERSONNEL MASTER AGREEMENT

###### SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 7 & 7-70, LAUREL MONTANA

THIS AGREEMENT, entered into this 12th day of June, 2017 between the BOARD OF
TRUSTEES OF SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 7 and 7-70, of Laurel, Yellowstone-Carbon
Counties, State of Montana, acting in the name of said District, hereinafter referred to as the
“Board”, and the Laurel Unified Education Association – Certified Unit of Laurel, Montana,
hereinafter referred to as the “Association”.

## ARTICLE I – RECOGNITION AND JURISDICTION CONTENTS

A. Board Recognition. The Association shall recognize any agent of the Board selected to
represent it in any matter covered by this agreement as evidenced by a letter of
appointment executed by the Board Chairperson or the Clerk of the District. The
exercise of the foregoing powers and duties by the Board, the adoption of policies, rules,
and regulations, and furtherance thereof, the use of its judgment and discretion in
connection therewith, shall be limited only by the specific and express terms of this
Agreement and applicable laws of the State of Montana and of the United States of
America.

B. Association Recognition. The Board recognizes the Laurel Unified Education
Association-Certified Unit as the exclusive representative of the teachers employed by
the Board for collective bargaining with respect to wages, hours, fringe benefits, and
other conditions of employment; or in regard to grievance as mentioned herein for all
employees in the appropriate unit. The Board shall also recognize any agent of the
Association selected to represent it in any matter covered by this Agreement who is
evidenced by a letter of appointment signed by the President of the Association. Such
recognition shall be for the duration of the Agreement.

C. Teacher Definition. Unless otherwise indicated, the term “teacher”, when used
hereinafter in this Agreement, shall refer to all employees in the appropriate unit.

1. A full time teacher shall be defined as a teacher who works a full school term for the
    normal school day. (See ARTICLE IX-WORK LOAD, sections A and C.)
2. Part-Time shall be defined as any teacher who works less than a full school term or
    less than a normal school day. Benefits, leaves, PIR days, and years of experience
    for salary placement and reduction to force for part-time teachers will be pro-rated
    according to the portion of the school day worked or portion of the school term
    worked. For purposes of years of experience on the salary schedule: 1) a teacher
    working 90 days will receive a full step on the salary schedule; 2) a teacher working
    less than 90 will receive no step on the salary schedule. A teacher who works less
    than a full day will have his/her experience on the salary schedule determined by
    dividing the total hours worked by seven (7). This number will constitute the full
    days worked for applying the formula for salary steps. The district reserves the right
    to require each teacher to attend more than the prorata share of PIR days with the



extra days to be paid at the teacher’s daily rate of pay.

D. Recognition Clause. The Board agrees to recognize and deal with the Association as the
exclusive representative of the teachers for the term of this Agreement. The exclusive
representative shall represent members of the appropriate unit which shall consist of all
certified teachers employed at least half-time by the School District who are certified in
Class I, II, IV, V, or VI or by the Montana Department of Labor.
Related Service Providers are defined as School Psychologist, Speech Language
Pathologist, Social Worker, Occupational Therapists and whose positions call for or
require such certification, but shall exclude the following:

1. Certified individuals who are not currently under contract to perform classroom
    teaching.
2. The Superintendent
3. Principals
4. Substitute teachers and casual or temporary employees who are not under a
    teaching contract.
5. Supervisors as defined by the Act.
6. All other employees.

## ARTICLE IV – GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES

#### A. Definitions

1. A “grievance” shall mean an allegation by a teacher, teachers, or the Association,
    resulting in a dispute or disagreement as to the interpretation or application of any
    term or terms of this Agreement.
2. A “grievant” is a teacher, or teachers, or the Association making the claim.
3. Days shall mean teacher work days, except as otherwise indicated.

#### B. Rights to Representation

1. If a grievance has been formally presented, at least one Association representative
    shall be present for any meeting, hearing, appeal, or other proceeding related to such
    grievance.
2. If, in the judgment of the Association, a grievance affects a group of teachers or the
    Association, the Association may initiate and submit such grievance in writing to the
    Superintendent directly, and the processing of such grievance through all levels of
    the procedure, even though there is no individual aggrieved person who wishes to do
    so. Class grievances involving more than one supervisor and grievances involving
    the administration above the building level may be filed by the Association at Step
    Two.
3. The Association on its own may continue and submit to arbitration any grievance
    filed and later dropped by a grievant.

#### C. Individual Rights

1. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting the right of any teacher
    having a complaint to discuss the matter with the appropriate supervisor and to have
    the problem adjusted without the intervention of the Association, as long as such
    disposition is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement. The Association
    shall be notified in writing of the disposition of any complaint related to the
    agreement. Exhaustion of the informal complaint procedure is not a prerequisite to
    invoking the formal grievance procedure.


2. Grievants may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedure by themselves,
    or, at their option, by an Association representative selected by the Association. If a
    grievant is not represented by the Association, the Association shall have the right to
    be present and to state its views at all stages of the grievance procedure.
3. If the grievant or the Association fails to file a grievance or fails to move a grievance
    within the time limits allowed in this procedure, then the grievance shall be
    considered waived and the parties have no further right to the grievance.

D. Procedure.

1. Step One. The parties acknowledge that it is usually most desirable for a teacher and
    immediately involved supervisor to resolve problems through free and informal
    communications. Within twenty (20) days of the occurrence or of knowledge of the
    act or condition which is the basis of the complaint, the grievant may present the
    grievance in writing to the immediate supervisor, who will arrange for a meeting to
    take place within five (5) days after receipt of the grievance. The grievant and/or the
    Association and the supervisor shall be present for the meeting. The supervisor shall
    provide the grievant and the Association with a written answer to the grievance
    within five (5) days after the meeting. Such answer shall include the reasons upon
    which the decision was based.
2. Step Two. If the grievant or the Association is not satisfied with the disposition of
    the grievance at Step One, or if no decision has been rendered within five (5) days
    after presentation of the grievance, then the grievance may be referred to the
    Superintendent. The Superintendent shall render his decision within ten (10) days of
    receipt of the appeal notice.
3. Step Three. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of the Superintendent’s response, or
    if no response is given, the grievant or the Association may refer the grievance to the
    Board, provided the disposition of the grievance is not satisfactory. The Board shall
    request a meeting or hearing with the grievant, and/or the Association, to take place
    within twenty (20) days after receipt of the appeal. The parties shall have the right to
    include in the presentation such witnesses and counselors as they consider necessary
    to develop facts pertinent to the grievance. Upon conclusion of the meeting or
    hearing the Board will have twenty (20) days to provide the grievant and the
    Association a written decision, together with the reasons for the decision.
4. Step Four: Binding Arbitration.
    a. If the Association is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance by the
       Board or if no disposition has been made within the period above provided, the
       grievance, only at the option of the Association, may be submitted before an
       impartial arbitrator. The Association shall exercise its right of arbitration by
       giving the Superintendent written notice of its intention to arbitrate within ten
(10) days of the receipt of the Board’s written decision. If any question arises as
to arbitrability, such question will first be ruled upon by the arbitrator selected to
hear the dispute.



b. Within ten (10) days after such written notice of submission to arbitration, the
parties will submit a request to the Board of Personnel Appeals for a list of
arbitrators all of whom would be members of the American Arbitration
Association. If either party is dissatisfied with this list, then the parties will
submit a request within ten (10) days to the American Arbitration Association
for a list of arbitrators. With the exception of the selection procedures, the parties
will not be bound by the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration
Association. The party making the request will pay the filing fee.


c. The arbitrator selected will confer with the representatives of the Board and the
Association and hold hearings as promptly as the arbitrator’s schedule allows;
the arbitrator will issue his/her decision no later than twenty (20) days from the
date of the close of the hearings, or, if oral hearings have been waived, from the
submission date of the final statements. The arbitrator’s decision will be in
writing and will set forth findings of fact, reasoning and conclusions on the issues
submitted. The decision of the arbitrator will be submitted to the Board and the
Association and will be final and binding upon the parties.

E. Arbitration Costs. Each party shall bear its own costs of arbitration except that the fees
and charges of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties.

F. Jurisdiction of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have no power to alter, add to, or
subtract from the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall decide all substantive and
procedural arbitrability issues. Upon request of either party, the merits of a grievance
and the substantive and procedural arbitrability issues arising in with that grievance shall
be consolidated for hearing before an arbitrator; provided, the arbitrator shall not resolve
the question of arbitrability of a grievance prior to having heard the merits of the
grievance. The award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction should either party fail to implement the award. If a motion to vacate the
arbitrator’s award is entered in a court of competent jurisdiction, and the initiating party
does not prevail in the litigation, such party shall bear the full costs of such action
including, but not limited to, the adverse party’s court costs, legal fees and other related
expenses incurred as a result of defending such action.

#### G. Exceptions to Time Limits

1. The time limits provided in this Article shall be strictly observed unless extended by
    written agreement of the parties.
2. When a grievance is submitted on or after May 15, time limits shall consist of all
    week days, so that the matter may be resolved before the close of the school term or
    as soon as possible thereafter.
3. Notwithstanding the expiration of this Agreement, any claim or grievance arising
    there under may be processed through this grievance procedure until resolution.

H. No Reprisals. No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Board or the School
Administration against any person because of participation in this grievance procedure.


I. Cooperation of the Employer. The Board Administration, and Association members will
cooperate with any investigation undertaken in relationship to any grievance. Further,
the Board and Administration will furnish the Association such information as is
requested for the processing of any grievance. No teacher involved in the investigation,
processing, or hearing of any grievance shall suffer loss of salary or benefits.

J. Personnel Files. All documents, communications, and records dealing with the
processing of a grievance shall be filed separately from the personnel files of the
participants

K. Election of Remedies. The grievant/Association may have the grievance resolved either
by final and binding arbitration or by any other available legal or administrative method
or forum, but not by both. After a grievance has been submitted to arbitration, the
grievant/Association waives any right to pursue, against the school district, any action
or complaint arising from the same facts or circumstances. If a grievant or the
Association files a complaint or other action against the school district, arbitration of a
grievance arising from the same facts or circumstances may not be filed or pursued under
this Article.

## ARTICLE V – LEAVES


A. Discretionary Leave. Full-time teachers shall be entitled to twelve (12) days paid
discretionary leave each school year to be used for health-related or personal business.
Related Service Providers, as defined in the recognition clause, are excluded from the
above leave. Related Service Provider’s vacation and sick leave provision and its buyouts
shall be governed by Title 2, Chapter 18, Part 6 MCA.


B. Accrual. Annual Discretionary Leave is earned each month but shall be available for
utilization at the start of the school year. A teacher who does not fulfill his/her contract
and leaves the employ of the District having used Discretionary Leave in excess of days
earned, shall be monetarily liable for days used but not yet earned at his/her daily rate of
pay. Any portion of the Teacher's annual Discretionary Leave allotment that is unused at
the end of each contract year will be credited to the Teacher as Accumulated Sick Leave
to be used for sick leave purposes.

1. Requests. Leaves for purposes other than health-related shall require prior approval
    of the Administration. Application for discretionary leave of more than 3 consecutive
    days for purposes other than illness should be submitted to the administration at least
    five (5) working days prior to the leave, except in the case of emergency. Earlier
    notification for scheduled absences is encouraged.
2. Exceptions. Discretionary leave for reasons other than illness may not be granted for
    the following circumstances:
    a. during the periods of emergency when there are an unusual number of teacher
       absences previously requested/scheduled and when there is an inadequate supply
       of substitute teachers available. The Superintendent will notify the Certified Staff
       when such periods of emergency occur when some leaves may not be granted.
    b. during the opening ten (10) school days or closing ten (10) school days of the
       school year.



c. during building-specific Blackout Days to be determined by the Administration,
not to exceed ten (10) days per year, due to but not limited to semester change
and standardized testing.
d. during Parent-Teacher Conference days.
e. during required District staff trainings when training will not be provided again
and cannot reasonably be made-up or re-scheduled, provided that notification of
the required training was made to the teacher prior to the request for leave.
f. during PIR days.


The Superintendent may consider unusual or special circumstances in granting
exceptions to the above restrictions. Discretionary leave days can be used in
connection with holidays.

3. Increments. Discretionary leave and accumulated sick leave may be taken in half-
    day, full-day, or one (1) hour increments.
    a. One (1) hour leaves are limited to a maximum of one (1) per occurrence. The
       Superintendent, at his/her discretion, may allow hourly discretionary leave on
       early release days in increments greater than one (1) hour but less than half-day
       to allow teachers to tend to serious medical issues.
    b. For one-hour leaves, the Teacher shall be responsible to find a certified staff
       member in the given building to cover his/her class during the release time. If the
       Teacher is unable to find a suitable replacement, a half-day of leave must be
       taken. For half-day and full-day leaves, the District shall find a substitute.
    c. One-hour leaves may be used to cover late arrival, provided the teacher self-
       reports to the building administrator upon arrival.
    d. Half-day and full-day leaves for purposes other than illness will not be granted
       when a Teacher has too few hours remaining in their annual discretionary
       allotment to cover the absence fully. When half or full days are taken due to
       illness, hours or days exceeding the Teacher’s annual allotment will be taken from
       the Accumulated Sick Leave credited to the Teacher.
4. Accumulated Sick Leave. All Sick Leave accrued and accumulated prior to the 2011-
2012 contract year shall credited to Teachers as Accumulated Sick Leave.
Henceforth, unused Discretionary Leave will be credited to Teachers as Accumulated
Sick Leave at the end of each contract year.
a. Accumulated Sick Leave days cannot be used until a Teacher’s annual
Discretionary Leave allotment has been exhausted. Sick leave days that exceed
the annual discretionary leave shall be deducted from the Accumulated Sick
Leave days credited to the Teacher. Accumulated Sick Leave shall be used for
absences due to illness or injury which prevent a Teacher’s attendance and/or
performance of duties at school. Sick leave may also be taken for the serious
illness of members of the immediate family which shall consist of employee’s
relatives to the second degree of consanguinity and affinity (see appendix D).
Serious illness is defined as illness that requires doctor’s care and/or adult care
and covers transporting of members of immediate family to the doctor or hospital.
b. The School District shall notify each Teacher in writing, at least annually, the
number of sick days accrued.



c. Unused sick leave may be accumulated to a total of one hundred and thirty (130)
days. After three (3) consecutive days of leave for illness, the School District may
require a teacher to furnish doctor’s note. Upon request the employee will have

fifteen (15) days in which to provide the doctor’s note.
B. Bereavement Leave. Each certified staff member shall have ten (10) days paid
bereavement leave each fiscal year, not accumulative and not chargeable to accumulated
sick or discretionary leaves. These 10 days do not need to be taken consecutively.
Bereavement shall be defined as death within the immediate family which shall consist
of employee’s relatives to the second degree of consanguinity and affinity (See appendix
D). Additional bereavement leave days, as defined above, may be granted after
evaluation by the Administration. It is understood that decisions made under this

procedure are subject to the grievance procedure.^
C. Professional Leave. Two (2) days of Professional leave with full pay will be made
available to each teacher for the purpose of attending meetings beneficial to his/her
teaching assignments or extra duties. Additional leave may be granted on a case-by-case
basis at the discretion of the administration. Application for this leave shall be handled
in the same manner as discretionary leave.
D. Association Leave. At the beginning of every school year, the Association shall be
credited with twenty (20) days to be used by teachers who are officers or agents of the
local Association; such use, with pay to be at the discretion of the Association. Leave
time will not be credited against the Association for any meetings that would involve
meetings of communication between management and union. All such leaves must be
approved by the local Association President before they are submitted to the
Superintendent. The Superintendent may find some Association activities merit
additional Association Leave and is authorized with Board approval to grant such leave

without having that additional leave credited against the original twenty (20) days.^
E. Leave of Absence. Leave of absence may be granted by the Board of Trustees for
educational purposes, extended personal or family illness after all accumulated sick
leave is used, and serving in public office, and then only on an individual basis.

1. No increment shall be granted by the District for service of less than ninety (90)
    school days of the school year during which the leave was granted, except for
    purposes of serving in public office.
2. Previous accumulated sick leave earned (except by those taking leave of absence due
    to personal illness) and tenure shall be retained upon returning. Discretionary leave
    may not be earned during this leave. Assignment upon return may not be the same
    as that held previously, but it must be compatible with the training of the teacher
    involved. Seniority will be retained but not accrued during leave of absence.
3. See Article VI, Section D regarding eligibility for insurance while on leave of
    absence.


F. Family Medical Leave (FMLA): To be eligible for FMLA leave, an individual must
meet the following criteria:
a. Have worked at least 12 months (which do not have to be consecutive) for the
employer; and
b. Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately before the



date FMLA leave begins.

The FMLA entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take job-
protected, unpaid leave for specified family and medical reasons. Eligible employees
are entitled to sixty (60) workdays of leave in any twelve (12) month period.


G. Maternity/Paternity Leave. Leave under this provision will be in accord with the Family
Medical Leave Act (FMLA).

1. Leave of absence shall not affect seniority. Days of discretionary leave will be
    prorated.
2. The affected teacher shall be reinstated to his/her previously held position or to a
    similar position.
3. The employee’s rights, under the rights of this agreement, shall be retained.
4. The affected teacher shall continue to be covered by group insurance.


H. Jury Duty. An employee called to appear for jury duty or otherwise subpoenaed to testify
in court in any matter involving their role as a school employee shall not lose
compensation from the District for the performance of such obligation. The teacher shall
remit to the District any additional monies earned from the court or other party for the
performance of this duty, except those granted for expenses or mileage. Alternatively,
the employee may elect to use their discretionary leave to cover the absence and would
then be entitled to keep any additional compensation received for their appearance in
court.


I. Other Leave. Leave other than above shall be arranged for in advance and shall be
charged against the contract salary at the teacher’s daily rate of pay. Leaves under this
category must be approved by the Superintendent.

#### J. Sick Leave Bank

1. A sick leave bank will be established through the voluntary donation of one (1)
    accumulated sick leave day by each staff member at the beginning of each year. This
    Sick Leave Bank will be capped at 300 days. Additional donated days may be
    requested during a given year as the need arises. The days donated are non-
    returnable and remaining donations in the bank at the end of each year will carry over
    to the next year.
2. A teacher may access the bank when he/she has a serious personal illness or physical
    disability and has exhausted all of his/her sick and discretionary leave. A teacher
    seeking to access the bank must provide confirmation from a physician that the
    illness is serious in nature, either by the type of illness or due to the chronic nature
    of the illness.
3. Once a teacher returns to work, he/she will not have continued access to the bank
    unless (a) such a return is on an intermittent basis as provided for by the direction of
    his/her physician, or (b) the teacher’s right to access is reestablished in accordance
    with the guidelines provided for in Item 2 of this Section.
4. No teacher is entitled to draw more than forty-five (45) sick leave days from the bank
    during any year.


5. A teacher may also access the bank in the event a teacher’s spouse or child under
    that age of twenty-one (21) meets the requirements provided for in Item 2. of this
    Section. While using sick leave from the bank, the teacher may not receive pay or
    compensation from any other plans in which the District participates, either in full or
    in part. For purposes of this Section, compensation does not include District
    insurance contributions made pursuant to Article VI, Section A (2).

K. Abuse of Leave. Any abuse of leaves under this section shall be subject to disciplinary
action as set forth in Article XI of this agreement. Abuse of leave is defined as the use
of leave for purposes other than those set forth in the designated leave categories or a
consistent pattern of unjustified absences.

L. Approval of leave. Unless otherwise stated, decisions regarding leaves of absences shall
be made by the building principal or designated supervising administrator in the case of
district specialists. If a leave is denied by the building principal or supervising
administrator, the teacher may appeal that denial to the superintendent and subsequently
to the Board of Trustees.

    dismissal as a final and last resort. Any disciplinary action taken against a teacher
    shall be appropriate to the behavior which precipitates said action.

positions within one (1) year of the lay-off, the laid-off teacher with the greatest
qualified seniority shall be offered re-employment.

notice to accept re-employment. Notice and acceptance shall be made by certified

the School District.
12. The reinstated teacher shall not lose credit of any kind for previous years of service

    assignment for one (1) additional season/year. At the end of that additional
    season/year, the resignation will take effect without additional provisos. Illness or
    hardship cases will be given special consideration and must be approved by the
    Board.

instrument or procedures, an Evaluation Committee may be convened at any time by
mutual agreement of the Superintendent and the Association. The Evaluation Committee

representatives of the Certified Staff on the Evaluation Committee. All modifications or
changes to the evaluation process or instrument, approved by the Evaluation Committee,

1. Planning and Preparation
2. Learning Environment
3. Instructional Effectiveness for Student Learning
4. Professional Responsibilities

F. Evaluator. The Building Administrator or Assistant Administrator, or Administrator in
charge of particular District programs, shall be responsible for the formal evaluation of

these administrators shall collaborate on the teacher’s formal evaluation.

G. Cycles & Schedules. Non-tenured staff shall be observed in the performance of their
work assignments for the purpose of formal evaluation at least once yearly. Tenured staff
shall be observed in the performance of their work assignments for the purpose of formal

evaluation comments or conclusions.

3. Summative Evaluation. The Summative Evaluation process occurs at the end of
    the evaluation cycle. Using information contained in the observation process and
    additional elements, it determines a teacher’s overall performance rating. The first
    step is the Summative Evaluation Conference, followed by completion of the
    Summative Evaluation Form.

    observation. An Improvement Plan may be developed when a teacher’s performance
    in any domain or overall is rated as “Unsatisfactory” on the Summative Evaluation
    Form. While it may follow a disciplinary action, an Improvement plan is not itself a
    disciplinary action.
2. The Improvement Plan will include: specific concerns and expectations; goals and
    directions for needed improvement; a timeline for the improvement process; a
    summary of resources to be provided by the district; and an outline of the

    bringing closure to the plan. All documentation pertaining to the Improvement Plan
    and summative document will be kept in the personnel file.

and this file will be located in the District’s central administration office. Copies of all
materials in the teacher’s file will be made available to him/her upon request. Teachers
will be informed of all additions to their personnel files and no material pertaining to a
teacher’s conduct, performance, character or personality will be placed in the file unless
the teacher has had an opportunity to read the material and respond accordingly.

#### L. Individual Rights

    the right to submit those objections and concerns in writing, which shall be
    attached to the file copy of the Performance Assessment Summative Evaluation.
