# Convert PDF to HTML 

Use this site [https://pdf2md.morethan.io/](https://pdf2md.morethan.io/) to simply convert pdfs to markdown format. They will not be perfect but it will take far less time overall. 

If concerned about security or sensitive material, you can download the github repo [here](https://github.com/jzillmann/pdf-to-markdown) and run the application yourself in Docker.
