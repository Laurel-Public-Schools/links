The goal of the course is to provide college bound students with the scientific principles, concepts and methodologies required to understand the interrelationships of the natural world, to identify and analyze environmental problems both natural and man-made, to evaluate the relative risks associated with these problems and to examine alternative solutions for resolving or preventing them.
