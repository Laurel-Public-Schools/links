The calculus class will involve the use of derivatives and integrals of all functions. There will be applications of derivatives involving distance, velocity, and acceleration; length, area, volumes, business, engineering, science, and mathematical applications. The integral will involve Riemann sums, finding single and double integrals, and applications involving science, math and business. There will be an option at the end of the course for those who wish to take the AP calculus test. Graphing calculators will be used extensively in this class.
