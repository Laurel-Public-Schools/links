This is an elective mathematics class designed for students interested in the collecting and analysis of statistical data. The students will learn how to use standard deviation, graph analysis, probability, and population distribution, hypothesis testing, regression and correlation, sampling and confidence intervals as they pertain to real life statistics. Graphing calculators will be used extensively throughout this class. These calculators will be provided. Most college bound students will find this course useful and relevant. For the Advanced Placement test the topics are divided into four major themes: exploratory analysis (20%-30% of the examination), planning and conducting a study (10%-15% of the examination), probability (20%-30% of the examination), and statistical inference (30%-40% of the examination).
