Pre-Algebra is designed to prepare students for Algebra 1 as well as other high school level math courses. We will concentrate on the progression of the studentâ€™s basic math skills, including their number sense, and attitude towards mathematics. Pre-Algebra builds an understanding of various expressions, equations, and inequalities. Students will use basic tools of algebra; begin to use algebra to model real world problems, become competent with linear functions, and use graphs and other models to represent data.
