Communication skills are developed in language comprehension, listening, speaking, reading and writing. More advanced language structures will be targeted as language proficiency continues to be developed. The focus of this course centers on more literary-based sources and writing refinement. Students will also work on culturally-related projects and consider cultural issues in the Hispanic world. Fluency is stressed. At this level students prepare to take the AP test for college credit, college placement tests, or the CLEP test for placement at the University level.
