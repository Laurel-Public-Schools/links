Welding II is a project based class. Students will be required to design and complete several projects to be chosen by the student and approved by the instructor. The project must be within the studentâ€™s skill level and be pre-approved by the instructor. Students are expected to pay for and provide the majority of their own materials for these projects. MIG, TIG, Plasma cutting, and Forge work will be introduced to these more advanced welders. This class may be repeated for credit. Welding I and Welding II provide an overview of the welding trades and the skills needed to enter the job market.
