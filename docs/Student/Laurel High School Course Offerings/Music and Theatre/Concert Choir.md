Concert Choir is designed to further develop the skills begun in Chorale. Because of the previous experience in Chorale, Concert Choir students will have a more mature vocal sound and musically polished performance. Emphasis will be placed on becoming an "independent" choral singer and a moderately accomplished sight reader. Solo and ensemble opportunities will be available to those students interested in really growing musically. In addition, Concert Choir will have the opportunity to perform at District Music Festival.
