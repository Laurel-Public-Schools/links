Students develop a more sophisticated understanding of digital photo editing software.  Projects are designed to promote critical thinking and tying imagery with meaning and motive.  Major projects include an in-depth research presentation on a notable photographer and student-led investigations into digital photo manipulation practices and techniques.  Student are expected to demonstrate a strong work ethic.  It is essential that students be respectful, responsible team members.  It may be necessary, at times, for students to shoot photos off campus on their own time.  Due to the software used, digital manipulation is done during class time.
