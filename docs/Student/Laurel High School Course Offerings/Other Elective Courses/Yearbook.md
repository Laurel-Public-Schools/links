“The yearbook is history, local and specific. It offers a sense of nostalgia with the possibility of a collected community perspective... Nearly every handwritten, superimposed comment speculates on the future. The yearbook is a motivational expression of community, one fond or blunt comment at a time.” -- -Yearbook Instructor Jon Appleby, Noble High School, Berwick, Maine
