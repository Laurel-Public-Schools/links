Photo III is advanced photography.  This is a portfolio class in which students prepare for professional training in photography after high school or work toward being highly skilled amateur photographers. This course is dedicated to compiling a body of work (portfolio) representative of the students' individual aesthetic.  Students are expected to demonstrate a strong work ethic and high degree of professionalism.  It is essential that students be respectful, responsible team members.  Projects are based largely on individual student interests and some photos may need to be captured outside of school hours.  Due to the software used, digital manipulation is done during class time.  Regular attendance is essential for student success.
