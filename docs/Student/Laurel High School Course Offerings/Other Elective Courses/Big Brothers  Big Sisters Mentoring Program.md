Each high school student will be matched by BBS with one or two elementary students. Students are expected to meet with each “Little” two to four times a week. Students will document each visit and complete daily journal entries. Attendance and daily logs are worth 70% of the grade, reflection journals are 10% and research papers or presentations are 20%. One day a week will be used to meet with the BBBS Case Manager. Because of the nature of working with young children, it is strongly encouraged to make this class a one year commitment.
