Photo I is an introduction to digital photography.  Photo I introduces students to the Fundamentals and Principles of Art, camera basics, photography composition rules, digital photo editing, and studio lighting.  Students will be exposed to a wide range of photography from the fields of both Fine Art and commercial photography.  Students are expected to demonstrate a strong work ethic.  It is essential that students be respectful, responsible team members.  Shooting assignments change with the seasons so it is important that students meet project deadlines.  Due to the software used, digital manipulation is done during class time.  Regular attendance is essential for student success.
