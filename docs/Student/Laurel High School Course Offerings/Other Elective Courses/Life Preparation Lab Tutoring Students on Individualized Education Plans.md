This elective class is designed for the student who wishes to obtain hands-on working experience with students of various academic abilities. The class also explores the teaching sphere of the regular education classroom and the Life Prep Lab room. The course consists of two parts: (1) Actual daily working with students of various abilities; and (2) outside reading, writing and research concerning academic exceptionalities in general. This is a good opportunity for prospective teachers to obtain “hands on” experience. The student must meet with the instructor and discuss taking the course prior to enrollment.
