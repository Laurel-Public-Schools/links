## INTRODUCTION

## WELCOME Students, Parents, and Guardians To the2022-2023 School Year

All teachers, support staff, and principals of South, West, and Graff Elementary Schools wish
to welcome you to our schools for the2022-2023 school year. Our goal is to foster positive
relationships between our school’s personnel, students, parents, and guardians.

It is our intention to create a positive, safe, atmosphere that will maximize educational
opportunities for all students. In order for students to learn to communicate and cooperate, an
understanding must exist between home and school. We encourage you to visit our schools, attend
parent/guardian/teacher meetings, join the elementary PTA and become involved in your child(ren)’s
school.

This handbook is written to assist parents/guardians in understanding the policies and
regulations, which govern the operation of the elementary schools in Laurel School District No. 7 and
7-70. We also wish to provide information that is important to each student’s education. Please keep
your handbook at home so that it is readily available throughout the year. Should you have any
questions, which are not covered in this handbook, contact the school for assistance.

**Laurel School District Mission Statement**


The Laurel School District is dedicated to the individual development of each
student every day, without exception.

Boost Program arrival times are the following: 8:30 a.m. for Group I and 12:00 p.m. for Group

### RECESS

Students are expected to go out to the playground during recess except during bad weather (less
than 0 degrees or severe wind chills) when recesses will be modified. Please have children dressed
appropriately for the temperature (winter coats, boots, hats, and gloves/mittens). **If there is a need
for a student to remain indoors during recess, a note is required, and for extended periods of
more than 2 days, a doctor’s excuse is necessary. If students are well enough to attend
school, they are expected to participate in recess.**

### SUPERVISION

Adult supervisionbegins at **7:30 a.m. at South andWest, and Graff**. For the student’s safety, they
should not arrive at school or be on the grounds before this time. The playground is also supervised
during recess periods and during lunch period.

### BUILDING ENTRY/DOOR PROCEDURE

All Elementary Campuses are closed campuses. Visitors are not allowed on school property without
having checked in at the school office, verifying their identity and purpose for visit, and obtaining a
Visitor’s badge. At each elementary school, the school office is immediately inside and to the right of
the main entry door. All doors will be kept locked. At the main entry visitors must press the buzzer by
the door to be admitted by a member of the school staff. **Please have your ID ready**.

### LEAVING SCHOOL DURING THE DAY

Children leaving school during school hours for any reason should bring a signed note from their
parents/guardians in advance asall of the elementarycampuses are closed. No pupil will be allowed
to leave the school during the school day with any adult other than a parent or guardian until proper
permission is given by the parent/guardian. When a parent/guardian wishes to check their child out
from school, a picture ID must be shown at the office and the adult must be a listed contact person
on the child’s information record, or parent permission is granted in writing or a phone call.

After the afternoon dismissal, going home with a friend is the responsibility of the student and his/her
parents/guardians. Please attempt to make medical and other appointments before or after the
school day.


## ATTENDANCE POLICY

The State of Montana has made education compulsory for all children from the ages of 7 to 16 years
of age. Therefore, absence from school without adequate reason is illegal and parents are in
violation of the law. (MCA 20-5-103)

Attendance in all classes by students enrolled in Laurel Elementary Schools is expected; and
students are responsible for being in class on time, prepared to learn.

Any time you leave the building, you must:

1. **Have permission from your parent or guardian before you leave** – either bring a note to
    school with you, or call your parent or guardian from school and have the secretary in the
    office talk to them.
2. **Check out** with the secretary in the office. **Failureto check out properly through the**
    **office will be considered an absence.**

### ATTENDANCE PHILOSOPHY

Since attendance in school is paramount to realizing the utmost in one’s education, the school
district will utilize every effort to keep students in school. The intent of the 10-day rule is to stress to
students and parents the importance of class attendance and to provide for greater student
accountability, not to punish students who have legitimate absences approved beforehand. This
attendance criterion is based on the fact that prompt and regular attendance in school is the
beginning of dependability in adult, business, personal, and social life. Furthermore, regular
attendance is important because valuable skills and information gained in the classroom, may or
may not show up on tests, or be reflected in an academic grade.

Parents/guardians are to keep the school informed of their child’s absence. They are expected to
comply with state and local school laws and rules regarding school attendance.

**Parents/guardians are urged to arrange physicals, doctor and dental appointments, etc. on
weekends, Wednesday after 2:30, during the summer, or during school holidays in order to
minimize the loss of school time.**

Teachers have a right to expect regular attendance from their students. Teachers shall assist
students with makeup work whenever absences have been for a good cause.

### 10 DAY RULE

**1. A student will be allowedten (10)absences per semester.**
    An absence is any time the student is not physically present in class.
    Students who are absent will be permitted to make up work missed and to receive grades for
    time absent. The responsibility of contacting the instructors, getting assignments, doing the
    work, and submitting it to the instructor rests with the student.


A student will be permitted one (1) day for each day absent to complete make-up
work.


If a student is to be absent, the parent/guardian must call the school any time or send a note
to notify the school of the absence. If the parent/guardian does not call, the District will make
an effort to call the home when an absence has occurred.


**2. The ONLY absences that WILL NOT be used in calculating the attendance record are:**

    A. Those that occur due to school-sponsored activities, since these are considered an
       equivalent educational experience. These exemptions will apply to students participating
       in sports events, music related events, academic field trips, and others deemed
       co-curricular.
    B. Bereavement in the immediate family (grandmother, grandfather, father, mother, sister,
       brother). Parent/guardian must notify the school. Any extended bereavement may be
       reviewed by the administration.

    C. Subpoenas to appear in court or court-ordered, out-of-district placements for special
       services; and

    D. Long term illness and/or hospitalization verified by a doctor’s statement. Medical/Dental
       appointments verified by a doctor’s statement. Doctor’s notes must be provided in a
       timely fashion within three (3) school days of the return of an absence that exceeds the
       attendance policy.
3. Absences that will be counted in the ten (10) day limit include such things as:
    Suspension in and out of school, illness (without Dr. note), family trips, visiting friends or
    relatives, skiing, hunting, attending concerts / tournaments, shopping, or any others not
    covered in section 2.
**4. After seven (7) absences from school/class, a letter will be sent to the student’s home,**
    **indicating the school policy and the number of days missed.
5. On the tenth (10) absence from school/class, a letter will be sent to the student’s**
    **home, indicating the school policy and the number of days missed. A parent / student**
    **attendance contract may be required.**
6. **On the eleventh (11) absence, the proper legal authorities may be notified**.

### KINDER BOOST PROGRAM ATTENDANCE

Regular school attendance is a component to a child’s academic success. Children who do not
attend on a regular basis, are routinely late, or routinely leave the program early may risk being
disenrolled. In addition, children who are late, leave early or are absent for ten consecutive days
without a medical or other reasonable explanation may be disenrolled from the program.

### TARDIES

A student is tardy when he/she is not physically in the classroom at the time the bell rings. Students
who are late arrivals create a disruption to the learning environment. When a child arrives late at the
beginning of the day both attendance and lunch count need to be adjusted and sent to the
appropriate people and the child misses sharing time and critical information regarding the daily
schedule that sets the tone for the day.

Tardies will be monitored by the office. In the event ofexcessive tardies (more than 10)families will
be contacted to assist in the development of a plan to alleviate the problem. Continued tardiness
may result in notification of legal authorities.


## PARENT/GUARDIAN COMMUNICATION

### CHANGE OF ADDRESS AND EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBER

It is extremely important that the school be notified whenever there is a change in a child’s address
or telephone number. The name of a neighbor or relative who can be contacted should also be given
to the school in the event that your child becomes ill and you cannot be reached. Parents/guardians
have the responsibility to keep emergency numbers current.Please contact your school office
whenever your address or telephone number changes.

### MISSING CHILD PHOTO REPOSITORY

The repository is authorized by Montana Code Annotated (20-7-1317, MCA) and requires the
Montana Office of Public Instruction (OPI) to create and maintain an electronic directory photograph
repository of all Montana students for the exclusive purpose of location missing school-age children.
The repository provides immediate and 24/7 year-round access to a child’s school directory
photograph to law enforcement should a child be reported missing. Annually, districts must provide
parents and guardians notice of the repository and a form to opt-in their student(s).

**Who will have access to my child’s photograph in the photo repository?**

Your child’s photograph will only be used by law enforcement for the express purpose of locating
your child should he/she be reported to law enforcement as missing. No other use by OPI or law
enforcement is permitted. Access by OPI staff will be strictly limited and controlled to staff or
contractors creating and maintaining the repository.

**How do I remove my child’s photograph from the photograph repository?**

A parent can opt-out at any time. Contact your school/district to request your child’s photograph be
removed.

**How long will my child’s photography be in the repository?**

Photos will be updated annually; if the photo is not updated and the parent doesn’t opt-out, the photo
will be purged from the repository after two years.

Please visithttps://doimt.gov/missing-persons/tofind out more about missing school-age children.

### STUDENT PROGRESS REPORTS

Progress Reports are summarized every nine (9) weeks of school. Multiple assessment methods will
be utilized to determine your child’s progress toward mastery of the standards. Students will also be
expected to demonstrate work habits in: Responsibility, Participation, Assignment Completion,
Interpersonal Skills and Organization.

### STUDENT RECORDS

The maintenance, transfer, and disclosure of student records shall be provided for as required in the
Family Education Rights and Privacy Act. A student’s records shall be available only to school
personnel on a “need-to-know” basis. These records are open to inspection by the student’s parent
or guardian by appointment.

### VISITATIONS

**You are welcome to visit our schools but we encourage you to give us 24-hour notice**. Please
check in at the office, obtain a visitor's badge, and be sure the secretary or principal is aware that


you are in the building. Do not expect to conference with your child’s teacher when class is in
session.

### CONFERENCES

Conferences with parents/guardians, grades K-4, are scheduled in November. You are invited to call
for an appointment for additional conferences with your child’s teacher or the principal at any time
during the year. You and the teacher need to work as a cooperative team in order to help your child
make his/her greatest progress.


## GENERAL INFORMATION

### SCHOOL BREAKFAST/LUNCH PROGRAM

Breakfast and lunch are served each day in the cafeteria or gym. Good manners as well as
good health habits are expected. Breakfast is $1.50 and lunch is $2.80 daily per student and

$4.65 daily for adults. Individual (8 oz.) milk cartons may be purchased for .50 cents each. With
our computerized lunch accounting program each student will be issued an account number
instead of lunch tickets. Any amount may be deposited into a student’s lunch account. Money is
carried over to the next school year unless a refund is requested.

**As stated in Board Policy #8205, “** **_after an accounthas a negative balance of $25.00, a
phone call will be made to the parent to inform them that they are responsible for
providing their child with a meal. No further meals will be served to the child until there is_**

**_a positive balance in the meal account. The food service personnel and principal will
monitor the student at meal periods to ensure the student is receiving a breakfast/lunch
provided by the parent_** **”. Qualifying for free or reducedlunch also will qualify a family for
free or reduced breakfast.**

If a student has a food allergy, a note from a doctor must be sent to school. A copy of this note
will be given to the cook and a copy will be put in the child’s cumulative file. Please notify us
upon any change of status.

### SAFETY DRILLS

Fire and other student security drills are conducted on a regular basis as prescribed by State
and District regulations. Students are expected to conduct themselves in a serious manner
while participating in all drills. All persons within the building are required to follow building
procedures.

### TELEPHONE

The school telephone is to be used for school-related business. Matters of a social nature
should be attended to without using the school telephone. Permission must be obtained before
a student may use the school telephone. Please do not expect calls to be transferred to the
classroom during the school day. Each teacher has voice mail or a message may be left with the

office.

### PERSONAL ELECTRONIC DEVICES

Students may use these devices on their way to and from school. If brought to school the device
must be turned off and remain in the student’s backpack during school hours. Unauthorized use
of these devices will result in confiscation by school personnel. Confiscated devices will be

returned to the parent/guardian. Repeated unauthorized use will result in disciplinary action.

### CLOSING OF SCHOOL

In case it should be necessary to close school due to bad weather, failure of the heating system,
or some similar case, arrangements will be made to broadcast such a notice over local radio
and news stations between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. The District’s All Call System will be utilized

in such events.


### SUITABLE SCHOOL CLOTHING

Extreme modes of dress are unacceptable. Occasionally, students select clothing that is

distracting to the educational process. Any clothing advertising a drug, alcohol, or tobacco
product will be considered inappropriate. In these cases, the student will be asked to change.
Clothing that is see-through, revealing, suggestive, or otherwise inappropriate will not be
allowed. Also considered inappropriate are spaghetti strap tops, belly shirts and shorts or skirts

that are less than fingertip length. Your child will need seasonal, comfortable clothing that
he/she can handle alone. Items, which are usually removed at school, should be easy to put on
and remove by the child and be plainly marked with his/her name. Hairstyles or coloring that
cause student distraction or lack of academic concentration will not be allowed.

### LOST AND FOUND ARTICLES

Lost and found items are kept for a reasonable time so that they can be reclaimed. Periodically,
items will be donated to local charities. PLEASE help out by clearly marking your child’s boots,
coats, hats, mittens, and backpacks. It is worth the time.

### PERSONAL PROPERTY

Toys or games (including trading cards, fidgets/spinners, rubics cubes, etc.) are to be left at

home. Our schools cannot be responsible for those items brought to school, then lost, broken,
or stolen.

### PETS AT SCHOOL

When pets are allowed to follow children to school they are a persistent nuisance. Your
assistance with this problem would be appreciated. The animal warden will be contacted if a

problem exists. The classroom teacher must give advanceapprovalbefore bringing animals for
“show & tell. ”Proof of immunization/rabies must be presented to the teacher/principal prior to
the visit for all dogs and cats.

### WHEELS ON SCHOOL GROUNDS

For the protection of the student using these and the safety of other students, the following

should not be used in school or on the school grounds; shoes with wheels, skateboards,
roller-skates or scooters.

### SCHOOL PARTIES

School parties are planned for holidays K-4. Treats are brought by the students on a rotation
basis. The Laurel elementary schools are encouraging “healthy” snacks (low sugar and fat) to

be brought for all parties and celebrations. (Please check with your child’s teacher for any food
allergies in the class.)

### PARTY INVITATIONS

Party invitations should not be distributed at school. It is difficult to explain to a youngster why
he/she was left out. Feelings get hurt easily and needlessly. Invitations can be distributed after

school or in the evenings, and will be less visible to those not receiving one.

### BIRTHDAY PARTY TREATS

Birthday treats brought to school to help celebrate a student’s birthday at school, in accordance
with Eat Right Montana guidelines, should consist of healthy treats. Please consider our many


students who must avoid sugars or nuts when sending treats. We encourageallstudents to
serve healthy treats for birthdays.


Healthy Treats

Fruit-fresh or dried Pretzels Vegetables
Raisins Snack crackers Cheese sticks
Yogurt sticks Beef jerky Meat, cheese or fruit

Please check with classroom teachers for any diabetic children or food allergies before bringing

classroom treats.

### ACTIVITY TICKETS

Activity tickets for high school athletic events are available to elementary students for a nominal
fee and can be purchased at the High School office. We encourage students to attend activities
and support the Laurel teams.

### FAMILY NIGHT

Family Night will be observed in the district on Wednesday every week. The following are
applicable:


● -No scheduled activities after 6:00 p.m.
● -Homework or tests cannot be assigned on Wednesday due on Thursday.
● -Homework or tests can be assigned earlier in the week due on Thursday.


## TRANSPORTATION

### BUSES

**If you have questions about bus service, please call 628-7630.**

School transportation is furnished to the rural children in an effort to provide the same education
given to children who live closer to urban schools. Regulations and responsibilities have been
established to provide for the safety of all students. A copy of these rules is given to each bus
student.

When your son/daughter does not ride the bus in the afternoon, we require a call or a note from you
to this effect since the teacher on bus duty must account for each bus student on a daily basis.

Only certified and assigned riders will be allowed to ride the bus. Inemergency situations,
parents/guardians may request (in writing) that non-certified riders be granted permission to ride the
bus.Prior approvalmust be received from the buildingprincipal.

The District’s All Call System will be used in case of bus cancellations.

### BICYCLES

Bike racks are provided and students are expected to use them. Students should not play with their
bike or someone else’s bike at school. Students are encouraged to wear helmets and use bike
locks. A school may designate a specific bike route for the safety of students. Students are expected
to walk their bikes on school property. Bike safety is everyone’s responsibility.

### FIELD TRIPS

Class field trips are valuable because they provide concrete learning experiences, an opportunity for
training in courtesy, safety, and good citizenship, and encourage children’s interest in the community.
**Field trips are aprivilege**. It is our expectationthat participating students will have demonstrated
good behavior, a positive attitude, and good work/study habits. You will be notified when your child’s
class is planning a trip and you will be asked to give your permission for your child’s participation in
these events. Emergency Medical Release forms and appropriate medications will be sent on **all**
trips. Parents/Guardians will be asked to sign an annual permission slip for in-district field trips. All
other trips will require a separate permission slip to be signed each time.

District insurance does not allow preschoolers or other non-school aged children to accompany adult
chaperones on school buses.


## STUDENT OPPORTUNITIES

### STUDENT SCREENINGS

**(Health, Hearing, Vision, Speech & Academic)**

The Laurel Public Schools routinely screen all students for dental, vision, hearing, speech/language,
and academic impairments, which may interfere with the classroom performance. Screening is a
basic effort to identify students who may have special needs. Your children will participate in
screenings as conducted by the school nurse, speech therapist, and special education personnel.
You will be notified of any problems and are welcome to discuss the results at any time. If you
believe your child has a problem in any of these areas, contact your child’s teacher.

### SPECIAL EDUCATION/TITLE I/SPEECH/504/SOCIAL WORKER

The Laurel Schools are committed to providing an appropriate education for all students.
Parents/Guardians and teachers may request a referral for special services if they feel that their
student would qualify and benefit from one of these programs.

### BIG BROTHERS BIG SISTERS (BBBS)

Big Brother Big Sisters is a school-based mentor program that allows your child to grow in many
areas of their life. The BBBS program is designed to build self-confidence, along with making
decisions and a sense of future. High school students are trained in using school resources,
academic performance, and attitude towards school, school preparedness, classroom participation,
and classroom behavior. High School Bigs are juniors and seniors who are carefully chosen to work
in a one-on-one relationship with a grade school child. The program runs year-long. Students are
matched with the same Big all year to allow for a mentor relationship that can hold them accountable
for grades and performance in school.

### YELLOWSTONE BOYS & GIRLS RANCH (YBGR)

YBGR School Based Services provide a program therapist and behavior specialist at the elementary
schools. This team works to provide mental health services within the school, community, and home
settings. Students must qualify for the service and have a funding source to pay for them. The main
goal of School Based Services is to keep at-risk youth in their primary setting. Through participation,
children receive individual therapy and group therapy, as well as classroom help and support.
Students are also invited to participate in a summer program.

### STUDY/HOMEWORK OPPORTUNITIES

Teachers are available before and after school for student assistance and parent communications.
Please contact your child’s teacher to make arrangements.


## PARENT/GUARDIAN OPPORTUNITIES

### LEPTA MEMBERSHIP

You are encouraged to become an active member of the Laurel Elementary Parent-Teacher
Association. It allows you the opportunity to meet your neighbors, school personnel and friends.
Special goals are addressed through the PTA; i.e., playground equipment, events to get families
together, support for special projects, etc. Many positive things have been accomplished through the
efforts of those who have joined.

## VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES AT SCHOOL

The concept of community involvement in education is providing great benefits to our schools. The
use of volunteers makes it possible to provide additional educational opportunities for our students.
Volunteers provide a variety of needed services and can help in the following ways: being a tutor,
reading/listening volunteer or serving as a resource person.

For more information about this program, contact your building principal or refer to the Volunteer
Handbook. We welcome you as a volunteer in our schools and thank you for your commitment to
helping our students.

### LAUREL COMMUNITY EDUCATION

Laurel has an active Community Education program. For more information about upcoming
opportunities, please go to the school district website [http://www.laurel.k12.mt.us.](http://www.laurel.k12.mt.us.)


## HEALTH

### HEALTH OF YOUR CHILD

Health records of each student are kept in **a securelocation** at the school. Please notify schools
when immunizations are received from sources other than the school. In order to handle emergency
situations, the school must know how to reach parents/guardians quickly. Parents/Guardians are
asked to provide the school with current pertinent medical information, emergency numbers and to
sign an emergency permission slip. If any information changes throughout the school year, please let
the school knowimmediately.

### IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENT

Montana State law and the Department of Health require all children be immunized against certain
communicable diseases at the time they enter school **.A documented immunization record is
required**. If a child is unable to be immunized dueto a medical condition, a medical exemption form
from the state must be completed by your child’s physician. Religious exemptions are allowed only
after the religious exemption form from the state is completed, signed, and notarized.This form must
be completed on a yearly basis. **Students must haveall immunizations by the start of the
school year. If the missing documentation is not presented to the school by the first day of
school, the student must be excluded from school (MCA 20-5-408), and may not return to
school until the records are provided to show current immunization compliance**.

The following is required by the State of Montana:

4 DOSES OF DTaP (ONE DOSE GIVEN AFTER 4TH BIRTHDAY)

3 DOSES OF POLIO (ONE DOSE GIVEN AFTER 4TH BIRTHDAY)

DAYS AFTER THE FIRST DOSE)

2 DOSES OF VARICELLA VACCINE (REQUIRED KINDER BOOST THROUGH 12TH GRADE)

Tdap WILL BE REQUIRED FOR STUDENTS PRIOR TO ATTENDING 7TH GRADE.

### MEDICAL INFORMATION

A doctor’s excuse is necessary when a student cannot fully participate in the regular school program
for an extended period.

Any child with the following symptoms should not remain at school:


● Temperature –100
● Diarrhea, severe cold, cough, sore throat, upset stomach, and/or vomiting.
o Please refer to the next page for guidelines on your child’s return to school.
● Skin eruptions or rashes will be considered a reason for exclusion unless there is a note from
the child’s doctor in the school file stating that it is not contagious.
● The rules and regulations for the control of communicable diseases are determined by the
State Health Department and administered locally by River Stone Health.

If in doubt, the school nurse can be reached at one of the schools during the day.


### MEDICATION

It is recognized that, at the present time, many children are able to attend regular school because of
the effective use of medication in treatment of chronic disabilities or illness. It is most desirable for
medication to be administered at home. However, when a student at the elementary level is
required to take medication during the regular school day, he/she must comply with the policy below:

1. Students taking medication prescribed by a physician must present the medication in its
    original container to the school nurse, principal, or secretary with the required medication
    form signed by the parent/guardian. A health care provider’s signature will be required for all
    prescription medication, vitamins, and herbal supplements used longer than two weeks.
2. Students taking over the counter medication must present the medication in the
    manufacturer’s original container to the secretary or principal with the required medication
    form signed by the parent/guardian.
3. The student must take the medication out of the container independently. This includes the
    pouring of liquid medication and the self-administering of eye or ear drops.
4. The initial dose must be administered at home by the parent/guardian to avoid adverse
    reactions from occurring at school.
5. Students must take all medication in the presence of designated school personnel.
6. At the parent/guardian request, the student may carry an inhaler with them, but must comply
    with procedures 1 through 4.
7. All medication must be stored in a designated area that is to remain locked when not in use.
8. The school is responsible for informing the nurse in writing of any parent/guardian requesting
    a child to take medication at school.

Aspirin, Tylenol, and Motrin will not be given unless it is sent from home in compliance with the rules
stipulated above. It is the student’s responsibility to come to the office to get the medication. The
school is under no obligation to seek out the child.


### ILLNESS POLICY – How sick is too sick?

When to keep Students home- by River Stone Health

In most situations the school prefers students to come to school and if they become ill at school, the

### HEAD LICE PROCEDURE

**1. When a student is confirmed to have live lice by the school nurse:**
    A. The parent is notified and information related to detection and elimination of head lice
       provided in written form. (see RSH HI-121)


B. The student is not sent home from school, howeverif the parent offers to pick up the
student, that is acceptable.


C. The parent is instructed that the student should be treated and reexamined before
returning to the classroom. See school nurse schedule for location of school nurse on
duty.

Upon re-examination, if lice and/or nits are found, the parent is notified to keep nit-picking and
combing (at least daily per day for the next two weeks.)

**2. When a student is found to have nits present (no live lice detected):**
    A. The parent is notified and encouraged to nit-pick and comb (at least daily for two weeks)


B. The student is not sent home from school.


C. If future checks reveal an increased number of nits present, the parent will be contacted
for follow-up and support.

**3. When to check beyond the identified student with live lice or nits:**
    _If_ **_live lice_** _or_ **_nits_** _are detected in a student, itis best practice to:_
    A. Determine if the student has siblings. If yes, then check the siblings in the immediate
       school.
    B. If the student has other siblings (not in the immediate school building), notify the
       parent/guardian of the advisability of checking family members and taking precautionary
       measures to avoid family infestation.
    C. Full classroom screenings for head lice are NOT routinely done. In some cases, the
       school nurse may use her professional judgment on an individual basis regarding further
       screenings.

“Studies have shown that control measures such as, mass screenings for nits, have not been shown
to have a significant effect on the incidence of head lice in a school community, nor have they shown
to be cost-effective” (Devore et al. 2015; Meinking & Taplin, 2011 CDC 2013a)


## DISCIPLINE

### DISCIPLINE OF YOUR CHILD - Policy

Discipline is managed behavior designed to develop within an individual responsibility for his/her
actions as well as recognition and consideration of the rights and feelings of others. Policies and
practices of discipline are intended to help achieve this broad objective while at the same time
achieving the ultimate degree of order in the classroom and in the school.

There are two purposes for discipline:

1. To make school a pleasant, neat, orderly and safe place to learn.
2. To help students learn what behavior is expected of them at school and in the community.

Parents or guardians are ultimately responsible for the conduct of the students at school. It shall be
the responsibility of the school, in cooperation with the home, to work in such a way that students
conduct themselves in a socially acceptable manner.

The goal of any disciplinary action will be to achieve a positive outlook, attitude, and/or behavior.
The fair administration of discipline creates a climate that enables every student to seek, without
interference from others, the education guaranteed by local, state and federal laws.

The school district endeavors to provide the atmosphere and guidance necessary so that each
student receives fair treatment.

Good conduct is expected of all students at all times and will be reinforced in a variety of manners.
PBSS (Positive Behavior Support System) is a consistent method reinforcing acceptable behavior
and administering predetermined consequences for unacceptable behavior.

Each school has developed a systematic discipline plan for the cafeteria, hallways, playground, and
bus lines. This is administered through the principal’s office.

Classrooms within the buildings tailor a plan to fit their particular needs, which is administered by the
classroom teacher. Both plans are compatible with each other.

### APPEAL PROCESS

The school staff and administration are always willing to discuss problems of disciplinary actions
taken. Parents/Guardians or students who wish to discuss any situations may do so by contacting
the staff member or the office and requesting a conference. If a problem arises in the classroom,
there is a proper sequence to follow:

1. Contact the teacher.
2. Arrange a conference with the teacher and the principal.
3. Arrange a conference with the Superintendent.
4. Arrange a meeting with the School Board.

When suspension of a student is involved, parents/guardians may avail themselves of the appeal
procedure in the School District Policy.
