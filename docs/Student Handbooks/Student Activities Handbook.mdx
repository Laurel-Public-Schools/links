2. Forincomingfreshmenstudents,the 4 thquartergradeswillcarryoverfromyour 8 thgrade

### Students Absent From School

There is a policy in the student handbook regarding students absent from school who are
involved in extra-curricular activities. This policy states the following: Students absent during
the day and/or part of the day on an activity or practice will not be permitted to participate in that
event. For example, suppose the student is absent the Friday before an event on the next day
(Saturday). In that case, they may be permitted to participate in the activity on that Saturday with
the consent of the parent, the Administration, and the head coach or group advisor of the event.
On overnight trips, when the team leaves before a Saturday, students absent the day before may
not be allowed to accompany the team. Approval for participation will be considered if the
absence in question results from a previously scheduled medical/dental/vision appointment. For
example, an appointment that satisfies requirements of the law, Senior Pictures being taken, or if
the absence results from some family emergency, or with the approval of the head coach,
building principal, and the activities director. A student will not be excused from assigned
detention time for practice or school activity.

### Students Arriving Home Late

Students arrivinghomeaftermidnight areexpectedtobeinschoolthatday.Anyexceptions
must go through the activities director or principal.

### Participation Conflicts

    student will be allowed to choose with no undue pressure or threat.
3. LPSeventshavepriorityovernon-LPSeventsunlesspriorarrangementshavebeenmade
    with the coach or sponsor.

### Responsibility for Equipment Return

The student must agree to be responsible for the safe return or replacement of all athletic and/or
activity equipment issued by the school. A fee will be accessed if the equipment is lost or needs
to be replaced.

### Notification of Parent/Guardians

Parents/guardians need to be notified by the coach when a given discipline action or other
failures on the athlete’s part will have a substantial or unexpected impact on the athlete’s playing
time.

### Participation Deadline

Students may apply to play a sport that misses the start of the season within **twelve** practice days.
Each Head Coach will have the final decision if approached by a student-athlete. Transfers
eligible for participation may start a sport at any reasonable time if the Head Coach and Admin
Team agree.

### 8th Grade Participation

8th graders will be allowed to participate in high school athletics in order to fill out a team roster.
The sports programs approved for 8th grade participation would be Boys Soccer, Wrestling, and
Softball for the 2022-2023 school year. 8th grade athletes will be required to attend a meeting
with the Head Coach, Guardians, and the Activities Director prior to the start of the regular
season. If a program does have low numbers, a recommendation and School Board approval
would be needed in order to allow 8th participation in a program not already approved.

## Code of Conduct

### LOCOMOTIVE CODE OF CONDUCT

```
I will be the best I can be and achieve at my highest level.
I will influence and encourage my peers in all their endeavors and projects
I will have the courage to take the “right” stand regardless of peer
pressure.
I will conduct myself in a manner that contributes to an orderly atmosphere and ensures the
rights of all individuals within the school.
I will be considerate and respectful of others.
I will give my best to my academic and extra-curricular pursuits.
```

I will demonstrate care and concern for school property and the property of others.
I will respond appropriately to the direction of faculty and staff at school and school activities.
I will be responsible for my attitude and behavior.

Failure of a student-athlete to adhere to the said above code of conduct may result in a
suspension from the program. Additionally, the Head Coach and AD/Admin will work together
using the Laurel High School Student Handbook and Laurel Public Schools Student
Transportation Handbook to determine the outcome of said violation.

### Expectations of Parents/Guardians

Athletic events are learning experiences for student-athletes. A ticket to a contest is a privilege to
observe athletic tests of skills, not to verbally assault others or be obnoxious. Audiences may
forget that high school athletes have not reached mature physical performance, so errors can be
expected. Moreover, audiences who learn the rules of the sport are less likely to criticize
officials, players, or coaches.

```
● Rememberthatyouareatacontesttosupportand cheer foryourteamandenjoy
the skill and competition, not to intimidate or ridicule the other team and its fans.
● Rememberthatinterscholasticathleticsarelearningexperiencesforstudentsand
that mistakes are sometimes made. Praise student-athletes in theirattemptto

### School Led Prayer

Prayer led by any school district employee is a violation of the Establishment Clause of the
United States Constitution. School-led prayer by a district employee is illegal and will not be
tolerated by this district

## Social Media

Derogatory remarks, comments, or pictures posted on any social media site or made by a student
toward anyone, including adults, will not be tolerated. This includes derogatory statements,
pictures, and videos made and sent via email, text, or posted to any social media website or an
app-based program. Any student found in violation of this policy **may** face disciplinary action.
The coach and Administration will determine appropriate consequences, including denial of
participation or dismissal from the extra-curricular. The Administration will make the final
determination.

## Risk of Injury

Despitethebenefitsofathletics,participationisnotwithoutsomeinherentdangers.Despitethe
effortsofmanufacturerstoimprovethesafetyoftheirequipmentandtheeffortsofthecoaches
to be properly trained, injuries do and will continue to occur.

Asaresult,webelievethatourstudentsandparentsmustbefullyawareofthepossibleinjuries

deprives them of any legal rights – itmerely atteststo theirunderstandingofthepossible

## Student-Athlete Advisory Council

To give student-athletes more of a voice, the Activities Department has created a SAAC. A
Junior or Senior will represent each program. Head Coaches and high school staff will submit
their recommendations at the end of the year for the following school year. Each member will
serve their term until graduation if selected as a Junior. In addition, a Laurel High School Student
Council representative will attend meetings and coordinate with the student body. The committee
will meet monthly with the AD to discuss the following topics and ideas.

```
● Promoting communication between student-athletes and the athletics administration
● Giving student-athletesa voicewithintheathleticsdepartmentwhennewpoliciesare
being considered
● Providing insight and feedback into issues affecting the athletics department
● Providing the student perspective on broader rules and regulations, such as those
proposed by state or national organizations
```
```
● Building a sense of community among many teams within the athletics program
● Organizing and participating in community service efforts
● Boosting theimageofstudent-athletesoncampusandcreatingapositivevibeforthe
athletics program as a whole
● Working with the current AD to promote community theme nights for sporting events
```

### Banquets

After each season, an awards presentation may be held. It may be in a banquet format or a team
gathering format. Parents and other family members can be invited. Banquet arrangements must
abide by the requirements and expectations of equity to be sponsored, promoted, or encouraged
by the school. All awards presentations must be held in a school facility. All award and banquet
expenses must follow a reasonable budget of funds that can be spent from the team account as
outlined by the head coach and the activities director. All MHSA Award and Amateur Rules

### Lettering

Each program head coach will establish the criteria for lettering. Any participant who
successfully meets that criteria will “letter” and receive the actual letter the first time, followed
by a pin for each “letter.” Head coaches have the discretion to determine who letters within their
program. Lettering criteria should be well communicated before the start of the season.

### Special Awards

The Activities Department will also recognize multi-sport student-athletes. Any athlete who
earns varsity letters in two sports will receive a dual-sport athlete award; Any student who earns
three varsity letters in 3 different sports will receive a three-sport athlete award; Any student
who has earned at least six varsity letters will receive a number six-letter to go on their
letterman’s jacket
