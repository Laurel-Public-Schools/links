You you also set your pricing category here but keep in mind, the district reserves the right to change this on your reservation if we determine you have selected the wrong one.

## LPS Staff

Our staff members now have a new way to reserve a space for use that does not require a reservation at all

:::note
This only applies to school events such as choir concerts, basketball practice, etc.
:::

Staff can simply use google calendar to make their event. On the right side of the screen, select the `Rooms` tab, and you can mark whichever spaces you will be using for your event. ![facilities9](./img/facilities9.png)
Any event added this way will automatically be synced with the reservation system, so the public view will still show the event taking place at your reserved time.
