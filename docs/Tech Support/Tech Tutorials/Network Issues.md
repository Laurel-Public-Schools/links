# Fixing Network Issues
## Symptoms
Losing connection to the internet is an issue we see a lot of but can have quite a few different causes and different solutions. This guide will help identify the source of your internet troubles.
## How To
1. The first thing we want to check is if your loss of connection is hardware or software related. Either cause will be indicated on your network connection  in your system tray in the lower right hand corner of your screen. 
You’ll get 1 of 2 types of icons if you are having connection issues. The red circle with a white X indicates that the computer see’s no connection at all. While the Yellow Triangle with the ! indicates it detects a connection, but it is unable to be completed. 

2. If you have a red icon, that is generally a hardware problem. Make sure to double check that your ethernet (usually the blue) cable is properly connected to the back of your computer and restart your computer. If these steps haven’t resolved the red icon, your computer will likely need further work from the tech team. 

3. If you have the yellow icon, start by doing the same steps listed previously for the red icon. After completing these steps and if the issue persists, right click on the icon and click “Troubleshoot problems.”

4. Windows’ built in troubleshooter will often resolve a lot of software related networking issues. If this fails to fix the issue however, please file a tech ticket [here](https://laurelschools.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2)
