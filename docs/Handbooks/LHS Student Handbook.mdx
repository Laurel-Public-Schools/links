## GENERAL INFORMATION

### WELCOME STUDENTS AND PARENTS!

Locomotive Strong:
:::caution Are you on the Right Track?
Be Responsible...Be Respectful...Be a Graduate
:::
As we begin the New Year at LHS we are excited that you will be joining in on the adventure. As you enter our doors
for the 2022-2023 school year you will find that we are committed to student excellence in ALL areas. This year we
continue implementing a block schedule and encourage everyone to become familiar with Gold Days (A-Block),
Purple Days (B-Block) and the Wednesday Early Release schedules. We also offer an intervention/extension
STEAM time to be used for a variety of supports for our students. We are excited to approach learning in a more
student centered atmosphere for 22-23. Our staff members continue to work hard in providing quality educational
programming and experiences for our students and families. Our commitment to being Locomotive Strong is a top
priority and will help build a dynamic learning environment for all members of our learning community.

Academics is the focal point of daily experiences at LHS, however students are also encouraged to engage in a
multitude of co-curricular activities and/or athletics that can be found on our campus throughout the year. Research
and experience shows that students who join clubs, activities, and/or athletics excel academically, socially, and
emotionally as young adults. Active engagement throughout high school leads to the development of responsible,
respectful, goal-oriented graduates ready for the challenges of post-secondary life.

Parents, guardians, and families are highly encouraged to remain that guiding force behind each student. We value
and respect the role the family plays in the development of our students and know that with that guidance, our
students experience far greater success in their lives. We as a staff at LHS look forward to the opportunity to build
strong partnerships with families in the process of developing the best characteristics and talents of our students for
success in their endeavors.

Our handbook provides the guidelines that are followed in the daily operation of our school. We encourage you to
review it fully. We have attempted to answer most questions we have been asked over the years, however please
feel free to contact us if you are unable to find what you need in our handbook. We will be more than happy to
answer your questions.

May you enjoy a successful, positive, and rewarding Locomotive Strong year at Laurel High School!

Have a Great Year!
The Staff at Laurel High School



Locomotive Strong:
Be Responsible; Be Respectful; Be a Graduate

If it should be necessary to close the school due to bad weather, failure of heating system, or some
similar case, arrangements will be made to broadcast a notice over local TV and Radio stations in
Billings between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. and by automated phone message.

## EMERGENCY DRILLS

Throughout the school year, a number of school fire/disaster drills will be held. Instructions, routes to
be followed, and exits to be used will be given to each class during the first week of school.

The importance of proper attention and sincerity during these school fire/disaster drills cannot be
overemphasized. Innumerable lives have been saved where proper training has made possible the
quick and orderly evacuation during fires and emergencies. It is against the law as well as a violation
of school policy to set off a fire alarm without just cause. Violators will be dealt with accordingly.

Please observe the following to the best of your ability:

1. Start as quickly as possible.
2. Follow the designated route.
3. Walk briskly, but do not run.
4. Move well away from the building after getting outside.

notified by mail and given the opportunity to "opt" your student out of all or part of the instructional
unit. Please ensure that your contact information, especially your mailing address, is kept up to date
at the school office.

### SEXUAL HARASSMENT

Our goal is to have a school where students can learn without pressure from sexual harassment.
Any student who feels they have been sexually harassed is encouraged to report this violation to the
Principal, Associate Principal, or any teacher, or parent/guardian. You have the right to learn and
participate in activities free of sexual harassment, the right to get help from your school to stop it, the
right to be free from retaliation or intimidation if you report it. You also have the responsibility to learn
about sexual harassment, to take it seriously, to tell the harasser to stop, and to stop your friends
and classmates when they harass others.

### SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY

It is the policy of the Laurel Public Schools to maintain a learning and working environment that is
free from sexual harassment.

It will not be tolerated for any member of the Laurel Public School staff to harass another staff
member or student through conduct or communications of a sexual nature as defined in Section I.
Supervisors are responsible for eliminating sexual harassment. It will not be tolerated for students to
harass other students or staff members through conduct or communications of a sexual nature as
defined in Section I.

1. Definition
    A. Sexual harassment shall consist of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors,
       and other inappropriate verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when made by any
       member of the school staff to a student, when made by any member of the school staff to
       another staff member, when made by student to another student, or when made by a student
       to a staff member, when:


Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition
of an individual's employment or education, or when:


Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for
academic or employment decisions affecting that individual or when:


Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's
academic or professional performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or
offensive employment or education environment.


B. Sexual harassment, as set forth in Section I.A., may also include, but is not limited to the
following:
Verbal harassment or abuse
Pressure for sexual activity
Repeated remarks to a person with sexual or demeaning implications



Unwelcome touching
Sexual assault
Rape
Suggesting or demanding sexual involvement accompanied by implied or explicit
threats concerning one's grades, job, etc.

2. Procedures
    A. Any person who alleges sexual harassment by any staff member or student in the school
       district may use the procedure detailed in the Laurel Public Schools Title IX Grievance
       Policies or may complain directly to his or her immediate supervisor, his/her principal, the
       superintendent, or the board chairperson. Filing of a grievance or otherwise reporting sexual
       harassment will not reflect upon the individual's status nor will it affect future employment,
       grades, or work assignments.


Any person who feels they have been sexually harassed is encouraged to report this
violation of policy. All complaints will be handled discreetly. Because a thorough investigation
requires that both the alleged perpetrator and the alleged victim be allowed to explain the
incident, anonymity cannot be allowed. Retaliation against an employee or a student to
making a complaint or participating in an investigation will not be allowed.


Investigation of a sexual harassment complaint will be carried out by the building
administrator. If a building administrator is the accused perpetrator, the superintendent shall
conduct the investigation. If the superintendent is the accused perpetrator, a person
designated by the trustees will conduct the investigation.


Violation of this policy may range from suspension up to and including discharge of an
employee or student expulsion.

### TITLE IX

It is the policy in this school district to comply with TITLE IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,
which states that, "No person shall, on the basis of sex be excluded from participating in, be denied
the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance."

A grievance procedure is available to handle any complaints. The following District personnel are
available to provide information, discuss your rights, handle any inquiries or complaints, or assist you
in any way regarding equity issues.

### ATTENDANCE

##### ATTENDANCE POLICY

The State of Montana has made education compulsory for all children from the ages of 7 to 16 years
of age. Therefore, absence from school without adequate reason is illegal and parents are in
violation of the law. Any student 19 years of age prior to the start of school must have School Board
approval to attend. Contact the principal to initiate the process.

Attendance in all classes and study halls by students enrolled in Laurel High School is expected; and
students are responsible for being in class on time, prepared to learn.

**Any time you leave the building other than at lunch and after school:**

1. Have permission from your parent or guardian before you leave - either bring a note to
    school with you, or call your parent or guardian from school and have one of the secretaries
    in the office talk to them.
2. Sign out with the secretaries in the office. Put the time you leave and where you are going.
    If you return to school, sign back in and put the time you returned **.Failing to check out**
    **properly through the office will have consequences.**

**Attendance Philosophy**
Since attendance in school is paramount to realizing the utmost on one's education, the school
district will utilize every effort to keep students in school. The intent of the 10-day rule is to stress to
students and parents the importance of class attendance and to provide for greater student
accountability, not to punish students who have legitimate absences approved beforehand. This
attendance criterion is based on the theory that prompt and regular attendance in school is the
beginning of dependability in adult, business, personal, and social life. Furthermore, regular
attendance is important because valuable skills and information gained in the classroom, may or
may not show up on tests, or be reflected in an academic grade.

The process of education includes a combination of instruction, classroom participation, learning
experiences, and study in order to achieve the maximum educational benefits for each individual
student. The regular contact of the students with one another in the classroom and their participation
in instructional activities under the tutelage of a competent teacher are vital to this purpose. This is
an established principle of education which underlies and gives purpose to the requirement of
compulsory schooling in this and every other state in the nation. The good things that schools have
to offer can only be presented to students who are in attendance. Having established the importance
of regular attendance as a base for a good education, we must consider the rights and
responsibilities of students, parents/guardians and teachers in regard to this attendance philosophy.

Students have a right to be involved in a meaningful program when in attendance at school. They
will be able to make up work missed because of absence for a valid reason. At the same time,
students have the responsibility to comply with school attendance rules and to make a reasonable
effort to progress in the school program.

Parents/guardians are to keep the school informed of their child's absence. **Excused absences
must be made within 3 school days of the absence.** Failure to excuse absences within the 3 day
grace period will result in unexcused absences. They also have the right to keep the student out of
school for illness or other valid reasons. Parents/guardians are expected to comply with state and
local school laws and rules regarding school attendance. Parents/guardians will be kept informed of
their child's absence.

Parents/guardians are urged to arrange physicals, picture appointments, doctor and dental


appointments, etc. during study hall time, on weekends, during the summer, or during school
holidays in order to minimize the loss of school time.

Teachers have a right to expect regular attendance from their students. Teachers should not be
expected to perform burdensome work as a result of unjustifiable student absences. Teachers shall
assist students with makeup work whenever absences have been for a good cause.

**Procedures for taking a vacation during school days:**
Parents must notify the office as soon as possible for known absences.
Students and/or parents, must contact each teacher at least 2 weeks in advance to allow time for
planning and gathering of materials.

Requests for early semester tests must be at least one month ahead, with the understanding that the
student might not have all instruction and practice completed for best results.

As much work as possible should be completed before said vacation and all remaining work will be
expected on due dates or the day the student returns.

### 10 DAY RULE

1. A student will be allowed ten (10) absences per class, per semester.
    An absence is any time the student is not physically present in class.


Students who are absent will be permitted to make up work missed and to receive
grades for time absent. The responsibility of contacting the instructors, getting
assignments, doing the work, and submitting it to the instructor rests with the student. A
student will be permitted one ill day for each day absent to complete make-up work.
After this time period, missing work will be added to Roundhouse List.


If a student is to be absent, the parent/guardian must call the school any time after 7:30
a.m. or send a note to notify the school of the absence. Failure to do so after 3 days will
result in an unexcused absence on the 4thday. Thephone number is 628-3500. If the
parent/guardian does not call, the District personnel will make every effort to call the
home when an absence has occurred.

2. The ONLY absences that WILL NOT be used in calculating the attendance record are:


A. Those that occur due to school-sponsored activities, since these are considered
an equivalent educational experience. These exemptions will apply to students
participating in sports events, cheerleading, music related events, FFA trips,
academic field trips, and others deemed co-curricular.


B. Bereavement in the immediate family (grandmother, grandfather, father, mother,
sister, brother). Parent/guardian must notify the school. Any extended
bereavement or appeals may be reviewed by the administration.


C. Subpoenas to appear in court or court-ordered (verified by a court document
indicating their presence), out-of-district placements for special services; and


D. Long term illness and/or hospitalization verified by a doctor's statement.
Medical/Dental appointments verified by a doctor's statement.


E. Attending an athletic event as an observer/fan under the following conditions:

1. A parent/guardian form (green) signed and turned into the office prior to the
    event, at which time a student will receive a yellow form to have teachers
    sign. The yellow form must be turned into the office prior to event.
2. Student must be academically eligible to attend the event.
3. Student will be allowed to use up to (1) absence per semester to attend
    tournaments/festivals in which LHS is participating.
4. Once at the chosen event, the student must check in with an administrator or
    teacher and give him/her the tournament form. Failure to do so will result in
    counting toward the ten (10) allowable absences.
3. Monitoring of Unexcused Absences:
A. After three (3) Unexcused absences from class/school, the parent / student will
be contacted. Additional consequences may be determined.
B. After five (5) unexcused absences from school/class the parent / student will be
contacted by letter and/or email. Additional consequences may be determined.
C. After eight (8) unexcused absences from school/class, the parent / student will be
contacted again by letter and/or email, and a parent meeting will be requested to



sign an attendance contract.

4. On the tenth (10) absence (excused or unexcused), a letter will be sent home indicating
    the severity of the situation and explaining in detail the consequences for missing more
    than the allowed 10 days. A parent/student meeting will be set up to sign an attendance
    contract for the student where the student (If 18 years old) or the parent (If student is
    under 16) could be cited for truancy by law enforcement.
5. Further absences will result in additional consequences.
6. An unexcused or unverified absence can be considered truancy. The consequence for
    truancy could result in detention up to and including ISS/ OSS. Severe truancy will result
    in law enforcement contact.

**Tardiness** : Students are expected to be to class ontime. A student is tardy when he/she is not
physically in the classroom at the time the bell rings. Tardies are addressed via individual classroom
expectations. If a student is tardy beyond 10 minutes, the tardy becomes an absence. An
accumulation of four tardies in any class will result in an unexcused absence.

### ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION

Students absent during the day and/or part of the day of an activity or practice will not be permitted
to participate in that event. If a student is absent the afternoon before a holiday, they may be
permitted to take part in the activity during that holiday with the written consent of the
parent/guardian, the administration and the head coach or group advisor of the event. On overnight
trips when the team leaves before a holiday, students who are absent on the day before may not be
allowed to accompany the team. Approval for participation will be considered if the absence in
question results from a previously scheduled medical/dental appointment, an appointment that
satisfies requirements of the law, attendance at a school related activity, senior pictures, OMV /
passport appointments, or if OMV / passport appointments, or the absence results from some
documented family emergency. A student will not be excused from assigned detention time for a
practice or school activity.

## GENERAL REGULATIONS

served. While eating in the school, all students are expected to be orderly, neat and quiet.
Students will eat in the Depot or designated meeting areas. Any violations observed by
supervisors will result in school consequences including loss of privilege of eating in the
school.


High School students will maintain a separate lunch account from elementary siblings. See
lunch policy guidelines under Board Policy #8205

**5. DEPOT STUDY CENTER/STUDY HALL GUIDELINES**
    ● Students will regard the study hall as a place to prepare their assignments and as a
       place of quiet study in an atmosphere conducive to study. They are expected to use
       their time wisely by studying, preparing assignments, or reading if assignments are
       completed. Sleeping and visiting are not options. Students should come to study hall
       prepared for the entire time.

       roll call the pass may be presented to the study hall teacher, to pass to the
       Counselors, Office, lavatories, or Library to check out a book. All passes must be
       returned to the study hall teacher signed and timed by the teacher the student went
       to **see before the end of the period**. No passes willbe allowed the last 10 minutes
       of the period.


*Other guidelines may exist per teacher discretion.

**6. CARE OF BUILDING AND GROUNDS**
    Please consider the cost and efforts which go into the construction and maintenance of your
    school. Those who damage school property will be required to make restitution.
    To ensure the privilege of having an open campus for lunches and snack and pop machines
    available in the school, students must take the initiative to keep the school grounds and the
    inside of the school clean by depositing their trash in the waste disposals that have been
    provided. The appearance of the school grounds reflect on all of us. Let's be proud of our
    school and be positive about our school grounds.
**7. CELLULAR PHONE AND PERSONAL ELECTRONIC DEVICES**
    In order to maintain an educational environment free from distraction, students are
    discouraged from bringing cellular phones, MP3 players, lpods, or other electronic devices
    into the classroom, unless approved by the teacher. If a parent/guardian needs to contact a
    student we ask that they call the office and leave a message, calls or text messages from
    parents to student cell phones are also not allowed during class time. These devices can be
    used during passing time, before school, lunch, and after school. If a student is caught using
    an electronic device at an improper time, or if the device disrupts a class, a staff member will
    take the electronic device away and the student will receive consequences per the LHS
    progressive discipline rubric. Failure to submit an electronic device to a staff member will
    result in a minimum of 1 day in-school suspension. If the student refuses to turn the
    electronic device over to the administration the student will be suspended from school until a
    parent conference is held. Other infractions of this rule will bring about further consequences
    which could include suspensions in school and out of school.



a. These devices are not allowed in the restrooms or locker rooms of the school AT
ANY TIME. If using a pass, phones need to be left with the teacher.

**8. EARBUDS, HEADPHONES, AND OTHER EAR COVERINGS:** Dueto concerns of safety,
    students will not be allowed to ever have both ears covered with headphones, earbuds or
    other coverings.
       a. Students will not use these devices during any instructional time.
       b. Use of these devices will always be at the discretion of the teacher during any class
          period.
       c. Use of these devices in the common areas of the school will follow the same
          guidelines as cellular devices, these devices can be used during passing time, before
          school, lunch, and after school. HOWEVER, only one ear can be covered at a time
          and volume levels need to be such that a student can hear announcements, bells, or
          alarms.
9. **CHROMEBOOKS:** LHS is a One-to-One device high school. Each student will be issued a
    chromebook at the beginning of the 9th grade year or upon initial entry to LHS. Students
    and Parents/Guardians will need to sign the RUP and review the LPS Device Handbook for
    details relating to use of these devices.
       a. Due to procedures of internet safety and GOOGLE safety features, students are
          HIGHLY recommended to use the school issued device for school related work
          during the school day.
10. **LHS Writing Expectations**


a. All writing and final draft work must be revised, proofread, and edited. Writing or
presentations/projects that have not been edited willNOTbe accepted byany
teacher. The work will be marked as missing and returned to the student. The
student will have an opportunity to make corrections and resubmit for full or
partial credit per teacher discretion.
b. Plagiarism: In an instructional setting, plagiarism occurs whenever a student
submits work that intentionally or unintentionally gives the impression that the
words or ideas originated with the student when in fact they are borrowed from
another source. Plagiarism in any class is unacceptable (and illegal). All work
should be original work and when sources are used, they must be credited. See
the LHS Plagiarism Policy for consequences.


## BEHAVIOR OR DISCIPLINE

### Plagiarism Policy

_Any incidences of plagiarism will be submitted as a referral note will in the contact log. The
plagiarism policy_ **_is cumulative_** _over the course ofthe current school year at Laurel High
School._


● 1st offense - 0 for the assignment with the opportunity to re-do for a maximum grade of a
C+ or below depending on the quality of the work.
● 2nd offense - 0 for the assignment and a letter willbe sent to parents/guardians with
a copy of the work in question
● 3rd offense - 0 for the assignment (whether it occurs in the same class or not) and the
student will receive an F for that grading period, in that class. If a student does receive
an F for the grading period, the percentage grade for that F will be recorded as one (1)
point below the established passing percentage required in that class. If the student has
already earned a lower percentage than that, s/he will keep the percentage points s/he
earned.

**Steps for avoiding Plagiarism**
Whether using APA or MLA the following statements apply EVERY TIME source material is
used _no matter the class (examples below are in APAstyle)._


● CITE all information (not considered Common Knowledge)that you take from sources -
whether you quote it, paraphrase it, or summarize it. Quotes should not exceed 10% of
the assignment’s word count.
● Use SIGNAL PHRASES when writing to introduce sourcematerial - so the reader can
tell when you are using source material and when you are doing your own
writing/thinking.
● Examples: Harvard professorMichael Franks (2013)discovered.....
Hodges (2015), high school librarian,explained...
● AUTHORIZE the source at least once by explaining whothey are/what they did that
make them an expert.
● Examples: Harvard professorMichael Franks (2013)discovered .....
Hodges (2015), a former elementary teacher, explained...
● Include a SEPARATE page (or slide) at the end titled References (APA style) or
Works Cited (MLA style) that is double spaced, alphabetized,and uses hanging indents
and properly formatted - not just a link to a website)
● Wikipedia should not be used as a source. We encourage students to use the
library databases to help ensure quality sources.


CHEATING AND PLAGIARIZING
All students are advised and counseled to avoid cheating on tests, copying another student's
composition or homework, and plagiarizing the ideas, words, or writings of another. Students
who are determined to have cheated or plagiarized will be given a zero on the assignment or
test. Teachers are responsible for notifying parent/guardian of incident(s) and will issue a
behavior referral.Use of a cell phone or unapprovedelectronic device during an exam will be
considered cheating.

**8. CLASSWORK AND SCHOOL RELATED ABSENCES**



Students who miss class for school-sponsored activities will be required to make up their
work. Each student will be responsible for contacting each teacher BEFORE he/she leaves
school. Failure to do so may result in no credit given for work missed.

**9. DRESS CODE**
    Clothing is to reflect respect for the district policies regarding sexual harassment,
    intimidation, and safety, as well as school position and philosophy promoting an atmosphere
    of tolerance. The School District reserves the right to determine what appropriate dress is.
    Students are reminded that their appearance significantly affects the learning environment
    and may even be a safety concern in some safety sensitive instructional areas of the school.
    Students are not to wear clothing that may create material or substantial disruption of the
    educational process; be destructive to persons or property; represent or encourage gang
    activity; advertise alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and drugs or paraphernalia;
    contain sexual connotations; contain spikes or chains; exhibit offensive or suggestive
    language or graphics; or be considered offensively revealing or distasteful.


● The following headgear is prohibited in the school building i.e.: (hoods, bandanas
and sunglasses)
o Caps and beanies may be allowed in the classroom at teacher discretion.


● Undergarments and shoes are required. However, undergarments should be fully
covered including bra straps and waistbands and tops of "boxers." At no time should
undergarments be showing through holes or tears in jeans/shirts or below the length
of a skirt / shorts, etc. Slippers and Pajama pantsare not allowed.

## ● Bare midriff, see-through and backless garments are not appropriate nor are tops


tied together by strings across the back or around the neck such as the "bandana" or
"halter" tied tops. Tank tops are acceptable if the depth of the armhole does not
reveal undergarments or allow the chest and back to be visible through the armhole.
Undergarments should be appropriately covered with outer clothing and straps.


● Shorts/skirts should not be shorter than the tip of the pinky finger of the student's
hand when the arms are hanging at the student's side and should cover appropriate
areas of the body at all times.


A good guideline is to dress in a manner that would be acceptable in the 'professional' and
'craft' job settings. Any other type of dress may be questioned and consequences assigned
as listed in the "Discipline" section of this handbook.


A teacher may require additional standards of student dress as deemed appropriate in order
to ensure a proper safety standard for the coursework/activities required in the class (i.e.
science, vocational classes, P.E. and any special project, etc.). This may extend to footwear,
fabric content requirements, head coverings, safety protection, etc. Failure to comply with
these requirements may result in disciplinary action under the "Dress Code" policy as well as
possible loss of points or credit for any work that a student may be unable to complete as a
result of non-compliance with the regulation.


Regarding graduation ceremonies, graduates are expected to abide by the grooming and
dress recommendations in order to participate in the ceremony. The pride the community
takes in its graduates should appropriately be reflected in the dress of those wishing to
participate. Specifics will be forwarded during the spring of the year. Questions in advance



may be directed to the principal.

## **The School District reserves the right to determine what appropriate dress is.

##### 10.EVENTS SPONSORED BY THE SCHOOL


Students at school-sponsored events on or off the school campus shall be governed by
school district rules and regulations and are subject to the authority of school district
personnel. A student's attendance at such events is conditional upon his/her observance of
school rules and regulations. All student meetings in school buildings or on school grounds
may function only as a part of the formal educational process or as authorized by the
principal.


11.FEES, FINES AND OUTSTANDING BILLS
Students will be provided with basic educational material at no charge. Students are
expected to provide their own paper, pens, pencils, erasers and notebooks; physical
education attire and athletic equipment; extracurricular attire which becomes property of the
student; and elective tuition for courses offered off campus. Occasionally student fees will be
collected for the costs of materials related to class projects that the students keep; voluntarily
purchased pictures, rings, publications, announcements, etc.; voluntarily purchased student
accident insurance; musical instrument rental fees and uniform maintenance; parking fees,
library fees for lost, damaged or overdue books; and driver training courses.


Students are responsible for the reasonable care of school property such as books and
lockers. Damage or loss of school property will result in fines which must be paid before
grades and transcripts will be issued. It is the student's responsibility to make sure that they
do not owe the school money for whatever the reason. Fines and charges not paid will result
in withholding of report cards and/or transcripts. At the end of the year, a notation is attached
to the permanent record which causes any transfer of credits or issuing of a diploma to be
held until the charge is paid. Students owing fine money will not be issued a locker or any
school equipment pending the payment of such fine.


12.HARASSMENT, INTIMIDATION, BULLYING (includes Cyber Bullying and Harassment),
HAZING and MENACING
Laurel High School will strive to provide a positive and productive learning and working
environment. Harassment, intimidation, menacing, hazing or bullying is prohibited and shall
not be tolerated. A school effort to provide learning opportunities for students about these
topics will be a priority.


Students whose behavior is found to be in violation of this policy will be subject to discipline
up to and including expulsion. The LHS Progressive Discipline Plan will guide the
implementation of consequences. Individuals may also be referred to law enforcement
officials.


Simply defined, bullying is when someone repeatedly hurts or scares another person on
purpose. Bullying, intimidation, and harassment are aggressive behaviors - words, actions,
or social exclusions - that intentionally hurt or harm another person. The aggressive
behaviors occur repetitively and cause an imbalance of power between the perpetrator(s)
and the victim(s).


This behavior can be physical such as running into people on purpose, preventing an
individual from going where they want, taking personal items, pretending to hit an individual,
etc. It can be verbal such as threats of harm or ridicule, calling names, describing individuals
with mean descriptors, making individuals uncomfortable, etc. It can be in person or through



the use of technology: e-mail, texting, voicemail, Facebook, Instagram, Snap-Chat, other
forms of social media, etc.


Hazing is considered bullying by Laurel High School. Hazing refers to any activity expected
of someone joining a group (or to maintain full status in a group) that humiliates, degrades or
risks emotional and/or physical harm, regardless of the person's willingness to participate. It
can be subtle like wearing a t-shirt or more overt like expecting students to participate in
activities outside their normal boundaries of comfort.
Behavior does not only affect the intended victims but those who observe the behavior as
well. Students behave differently at times to avoid being a target. Misplaced sentiment has it
that being bullied is part of growing up and builds character. This unfortunate way of thinking
is wrong and only damages students. The fact that a victim laughs or seems to accept this
type of behavior does not reflect true feelings and again the behavior does affect bystanders
as well.


If a student or parent/guardian knows of an incident such as described above, they should
contact the Assistant Principal, at 628-3500 as soon as possible. It is also appropriate to
contact the Principal, at 628-3500. More than likely the behavior will continue unless acted
upon. Discretion will be used when dealing with offenders and victims.

##### 13.INSUBORDINATION/LACK OF DILIGENCE


Failure to cooperate with school personnel which interferes with the educational process,
verbal abuse or defiance of school personnel, and/or failure to identify one's self to proper
school authorities are prohibited. This will result in serious consequences.


Each student attending Laurel High School is to seek an education that will lead to
graduation. The staff is committed to teach, motivate, counsel, and discipline all students to
ensure that valuable educational goals can be met on a daily basis. Those students who
consistently resist these efforts and exhaust remedies the school has to offer, or are in poor
attendance may be suspended.

14. **LOCKERS and BACKPACKS: Due to limited space, larger class sizes and safety**

## PROCEDURAL RULES AND REGULATIONS

Procedural Rules and Regulations for Laurel High School are included below. The constitutional
rights of individuals assure the protection of due process of law; therefore, this system of
constitutionally and legally sound procedures is utilized in regard to the administration of discipline in
the school. Three precautions which ensure due process are listed below:


A. The hallmark of the exercise of disciplinary authority shall be fairness.


B. Every effort shall be made by administrators and faculty members to resolve problems
through effective utilization of school district resources in cooperation with the student and
the parent/guardian.


C. In order to maintain a school atmosphere which is conducive to learning and which ensures
the educational rights of each student, the reasonable exercise of authority by school officials
is a necessity. In fulfilling this duty, the school recognizes the need for a fair and reasonable
procedure to assure each individual of his/her rights. Faculty and administration will make
every effort informally to resolve student disciplinary problems at the earliest indication that a
problem exists. If informal procedures do not correct the disciplinary problem, students will
be given the opportunity to know what rule was broken, the basis for the accusation, and the
right to present his/her side of the situation. Parents/guardians may be notified depending
upon the severity of the offense.

## DISCIPLINE POLICY

The philosophy of discipline at Laurel High School promotes a positive working relationship between
the teacher, student, parent/guardian, and administration. In order to help all students achieve their
potential, Laurel High School must have a firm and fair discipline policy that is administered as
consistently as possible.

Students need to know that "we live in a disciplined world." We have the choice of disciplining
ourselves or being disciplined by others. Discipline is controlled behavior designed to develop within
an individual, responsibility for his/her own actions as well as recognition and consideration of rights
and feelings of others. Policies and practices of discipline are intended to help achieve the ultimate
degree of order in the classroom and in the school.

Discipline should not be confused with punishment. The goal of discipline is to help students mature
as individuals, with mature attitudes and socially acceptable standards of conduct.

### THE TEACHER’S ROLE IN DISCIPLINE

The teacher has the primary responsibility and authority for the maintenance of discipline in the
classroom, in the school building, and on the school grounds. The teacher and student should first
try to solve problems on an informal basis. The teacher should contact parents/guardians to seek
their support in working out problems when difficulties arise. Teacher will follow their written
classroom discipline / management policy. If this fails to resolve the problem, the teacher should
contact the principal or assistant principal for advice and help to work out the conflict as much as
possible.Teachers have the authority to:
A. Deny certain classroom privileges.
B. Assign specific tasks to assist the resolution of the problem.
C. Use such reasonable measures as may be necessary to maintain control in the classroom, in
the school building, on the school grounds, and on the way to and from school.



D. Remove a student temporarily from the classroom by sending them to the office.
E. Recommend administrative intervention of a student from school.

### ADMINISTRATION’S ROLE IN DISCIPLINE

Teachers exercising reasonable disciplinary judgment will be supported by the principal and other
administrators of the school district. If the teacher's efforts to solve the problem are unsuccessful, the
student may be referred to the principal or assistant principal who has the responsibility and
authority to use such reasonable measures as may be necessary to maintain control within the
classroom, the school building, and on school property.

The principal and assistant principal have the authority to assign detention time or impose
suspension on students for failure to comply with school regulations. If it should become necessary,
the principal can recommend to the Superintendent of Schools the exclusion or expulsion of
students.

### FORMS OF DISCIPLINE-Definitions

The LHS Progressive Discipline Plan will be the first document of referral.


A. Suspension
A suspension may be an in-school or an out-of-school placement. Progressive discipline will
prevail. In other words, the suspensions will increase in length for repeated infractions. The
student will not be allowed to attend any school activity or be on any school property during
the time of suspension. In special cases the principal may request an extension of
suspension from the Superintendent of Schools or his/her designee.


B. Expulsion from School
A student may be expelled only by the Board of Trustees.

When deciding the consequence, the administration will first consult the LHS Progressive Discipline
Plan and then consider the following:

1. Severity of the action
2. Frequency of the action
3. Student's discipline history
4. Potential for further inappropriate action

The following Board of Trustees Policies are a few that are in effect related to student discipline,
expectations, and consequences. The updated and complete policies are available for reference on
the Laurel Public Schools Website: STUDENT DISCIPLINE-POLICY 3310

## TOBACCO-FREE POLICY

All school district property is hereby declared tobacco-free for all students. Use of possession of
tobacco products by minors is both against the law and district policy. No use or possession of
tobacco will be permitted on Laurel School District grounds or facilities. Limitations or prohibitions on
tobacco use are applicable during all hours**.** Additionally,the high school includes in this category all
e-cigarettes and supplies, vape 32 devices and supplies.

PARAPHERNALIA- Policies 2337 and 2337P (this is a partial list from the policy.)**


1. These rules cover the use, personal possession, sale, or distribution of alcohol, illegal drugs,
    tobacco, and the abuse of prescription or nonprescription drugs. The policy is not intended to
    apply to the use of prescribed drug's, under a doctor’s supervision, when those drugs are
    used in the prescribed manner.
2. An extracurricular participant is in violation of this policy if he or she is knowingly in
    attendance at a gathering or function where illegal substances (except tobacco products) are
    present unless it is a family or recognized community gathering or function. Even if the
    participant is not in possession of, or using, an illegal substance at a gathering or function,
    he or she will be subject to the consequences as outlined in this policy.
3. Any student who uses alcohol or drugs, possesses alcohol, drugs, and paraphernalia or is
    under the influence of alcohol or drugs on school property, or while in attendance at a school

    alcohol, drugs or drug paraphernalia as defined by this policy will be suspended, pending an
    expulsion hearing with the school board.
4. Violations- Please note the district may become aware of infractions through law
    enforcement or court officers. Otherwise, student infractions must be reported and/or
    validated by employees of Laurel School District or members of the Board of Trustees if
    action is to be taken under this policy. The district reserves its right to conduct its own
    investigation, make a determination of guilt, and apply sanctions independent of any pending
    court action against the student arising from the same offense.

All penalties for infractions related to any of these policies are addressed using the LHS Progressive
Discipline Plan first.

Additionally, there are penalties assessed for students participating in extra-curricular athletics and
activities. They may include but are not limited to the following:

## SEARCH AND SEIZURE-Policy Reference 3231 & 3231P

**Student Privacy** - The right to privacy is a fundamentaltenet of human liberty. Staff shall take
particular care to respect student's privacy. At the same time, they must protect the health and safety
of all students and promote the effective operation of the schools. The principal, the superintendent
or other such staff designated by the superintendent shall have the authority to conduct student
searches. They shall do so only upon reasonable suspicion and in the manner prescribed by district
policy. For purposes of this policy and subsequent policies dealing with the specifics of student and
school property searches, the definition of reasonable suspicion is as follows:

"Reasonable suspicion" is the standard for a search on school property or at school related events
which is based on the school official's specific reasonable inferences which he or she is entitled to
draw from the facts in light of the school official's experience. Specific reasonable inferences may be
drawn from instances including but not limited to, a tip from a reliable individual, suspicious behavior
which suggest that contraband is present, or a smell indicating the presence of the contraband.
Reasonable suspicion should not be based on mere hunch.

**Searches of Students and Their Property** : To maintainorder and security in the schools and to
promote a safe and drug and alcohol free environment for our staff and students, school authorities
are authorized to conduct appropriate inspections and searches of school property and equipment,
as well as of students and their personal effects.

**School Property and Equipment** : School authoritiesmay inspect and search school property and
equipment owned or controlled by the school (such as lockers, desks, and parking lots), as well as
personal effects left there by the student, without notice to, or consent of, the student.

School lockers and desks are and shall remain the property of the school district. The school
exercises exclusive control over school property. Students should not expect privacy regarding items
placed in school property because school property is subject to periodic checks or searches at any
time by designated school officials.

No student may use a locker or desk as a depository for a substance or object which is prohibited or
which constitutes a threat to the health, safety or welfare of the occupants of the school building or
the building itself. The board authorizes the principal, or other designated administrator, to search an
individual student's locker or desk when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the locker or
desk is improperly used for the storage of contraband, a substance or object the possession of
which is illegal, or any material which poses a hazard, for example: pepper spray, to the safety and
good order of the school.

Students are permitted to park on school premises as a matter of privilege, not of right. The school
district retains the authority to conduct routine patrols of student parking lots. The interiors of student
vehicles may be subject to search whenever a school official has reasonable suspicion to believe the
vehicle contains contraband, a substance or object the possession of which is illegal, or any material
which poses a hazard to the safety and order of the school.


**Students** : A student shall be free from searches ofhis/her clothing and other personal property
unless there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the student is concealing contraband. If that
cause exists, an administrator shall request the student to remove all items from pockets or other
personal effects. If the student refuses and there is no immediate danger, the administrator shall
refrain from a search until the parent, guardian or, in the case of possible criminal activity, law
enforcement officers are contacted. Pat down searches or other such intrusive searches of a
student's person will only be conducted by the parent, guardian, or appropriate law enforcement
officer.

Whenever deemed reasonable by the person conducting the search, the search will be conducted in
the presence of at least one adult witness and a written record of the time, date, and results shall be
made by the administrator, a copy shall be forwarded to the superintendent as soon as possible.

**Seizure of Property** - If a search produces evidencethat the student has violated or is violating
either the law or the district's policies or rules, such evidence may be seized and impounded by
school authorities, and disciplinary action may be taken. When appropriate, such evidence may be
transferred to law enforcement authorities.

**School Resource Officer** - School authorities may requestthe presence of law enforcement
officials to conduct inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school
property and equipment for illegal drugs, weapons, or other illegal or dangerous substances or
material including searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. In any situation
where the administrator is in doubt as to the propriety of proceeding with any search or seizure,
he/she is authorized to report to and comply with the directions of any public law enforcement
agency.

**Use of Canines for Searches** - School authorities mayauthorize the use of canines whose
reliability and accuracy for sniffing out contraband has been established to aid in the search for
contraband in school owned property and in automobiles on school property. The canines must be
accompanied by a qualified and authorized trainer who will be responsible for the dog's actions. In
addition, a local law enforcement officer will also be present during the search. An indication by the
dog that contraband is present shall be deemed reasonable suspicion for a further search by school
officials. Canines shall not be used to search students.

To help promote a safe and drug and alcohol free environment for our staff and students, canine
inspections may or may not be based upon a reasonable suspicion by the administration that
contraband is present.

The following administrative guidelines are applicable when school authorities authorize the use of
canines to aid in the search for contraband in school owned property and in automobiles on school
property.

1. There will be periodic searches each year in the middle school, high school and high school
    parking lot. All lockers and/or all vehicles may be searched each time.
2. Only the principal, asst. principal, the superintendent and appropriate law enforcement
    agencies will know in advance what day and time the searches will occur.
3. The searches will be unannounced.
4. If the canine identifies a locker, the principal or asst. principal will conduct the search of the



locker and its contents.

5. If no contraband is found, the student(s) to whom the locker(s) are assigned will be notified
    that the search was conducted.
6. If contraband is found it will be turned over to law enforcement and the student will be
    located and further appropriate action taken in accordance with Policy 3231 and other
    district policies and/or State and Federal statutes that may apply.
7. Procedures when the canine identifies a vehicle are outlined in Policy 3231.
8. Building principals may establish other such guidelines to facilitate the search process. The
    superintendent shall approve these additional guidelines.
9. A report on each search will be sent to the superintendent.

**Use of Video/Audio taping Cameras-Policy Reference 3235**
The district uses video/audio cameras on District property to ensure the health, welfare, and safety
of all staff, students and visitors to District property, and to safeguard District facilities and
equipment. Video cameras may be used in locations as deemed appropriate by the Superintendent.
Students in violation of board policies, administrative regulations, building rules, or law shall be
subject to appropriate disciplinary action. Others may be referred to law enforcement agencies.

Video/audio recordings may become a part of a student's educational record. The district will comply
with all applicable state and federal laws related to maintenance and retention.

## GUN FREE SCHOOLS

In accordance with the provisions of the Gun-Free Schools Act. 20 YUSC 3351 and applicable state
law, any student who brings a firearm onto school property, except as provided below, shall be
expelled for a period of not less than one calendar year unless modified by the board of trustees,
upon a recommendation from the district superintendent. In accordance with the provisions of the
Gun-Free School Zones Act. 18 USC 922(q) and applicable state law, students and other authorized
persons may bring unloaded firearms onto school property for use in instructional activities with the
prior written permission of the district superintendent. At the conclusion of the activity, the firearms
must be immediately removed from school property. No student shall possess any firearm, without
authorization, on the way to and from school, or during intermission or recess. Violation of this
provision shall result in discipline up to and including expulsion. The term "firearm" shall be defined
as provided in 18 USC 921. This term shall include any weapon which is designed, or may be readily
converted, to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive, the frame or receiver of any such
weapon, a muffler, or silencer of such a weapon, or any explosive, incendiary or poison gas. In
addition, this policy shall apply to any object brought to school with the expressed purpose of being
used to threaten or cause bodily injury. If a student violating this policy is identified as a child with
disabilities either under the IDEA or Section 504, a determination must be made whether the child's
conduct is related to the disability. If the violation of the policy is due to a disability recognized by the
IDEA or Section 504, lawful procedures for changes in placement must be followed for suspensions
of greater than ten days. Any student subject to expulsion shall be entitled to a hearing before the
board of trustees in accordance with Section 20-5-202, MCA. Nothing in this policy shall prevent the
board of trustees from making an alternative placement for a student in lieu of expulsion provided
that such placement removes the student from the regular school program. The district shall keep a
record of all students disciplined under this policy and the circumstances surrounding their discipline,


including the number of students expelled and the types of weapons involved. This information shall
be provided to local law enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies as required by
law. Items which are used to disrupt or interfere with the educational process may be temporarily
removed from a student's possession. Confiscated materials, may, at the discretion of school
personnel, be turned over to law enforcement authorities.

## GUIDANCE SERVICES

Please refer to district website under counselor page for more information.
As a student of Laurel High School, you should assume responsibility for yourself and for your
actions. Looking to the future, you should develop goals and plans to meet these goals. Your school
offers you opportunities. Your teachers and counselors stand ready to help you, but do not expect
that things will be done for you. Assume responsibilities for yourself. Look at your problems and
your shortcomings realistically. Review your plans at least yearly to assure yourself that you may
expect to reach your goals. Revise your plans as necessary.

To help you, the following guidance services are available:
● Counseling
● Testing
● Course Selection

**No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participating in, be denied the benefits
of, or be subject to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal
financial assistance.**

This is the annual public announcement advising students, parents/guardians, employers, and the
general public that all vocational education offerings are open to everyone regardless of sex, color,
race, national origin, limited English-speaking ability, handicap, or marital status.

Students planning to attend institutions of higher learning should follow the post-secondary
preparatory course of four years. This course would include courses in English, science,
mathematics, social studies, and possibly foreign language. Although many schools will accept all
graduates from accredited high schools for entrance, the trend is toward requiring higher academic
standards for acceptance. Students are strongly urged to consult the catalog of the school they
intend to enter to make sure of meeting the entrance requirements.

Certain post-secondary courses require specific high school prerequisites. In the event a student
does not have these, he/she may be required to take high school level courses without credit, which
may delay his/her meeting post-secondary requirements on schedule, or may even cause him/her
not to be admitted as a student.

Be sure to check prerequisite requirements, test data needed, application filing deadlines, financial
payment schedules, requirements for financial aid, etc. It will be time and effort well spent.

## CREDIT RECOVERY

Laurel High School, through several accredited providers offers a number of credit recovery core
classes for students who have failed classes and elective courses for students who have through
failures or extenuating circumstances been placed in a situation where more than 3.5 credits per
semester are needed in order to graduate. In order to take on-line or correspondence courses, a
student needs to petition his/her counselor and revise his/her four year plan.

A summer school program may be offered where credit recovery courses provide the partial courses


of study. A summer program will span six weeks, Monday through Thursday, and have 3 - 4 hours of
meeting time daily. Students who wish to look at the use of courses during the summer months need
to commit to the summer program. **A cost to studentsmay be assessed**. A determination of
whether a summer program is held will be determined by May 1 each year.

## CORRESPONDENCE COURSES

Credit for correspondence, summer school or night school courses may be granted provided the
following requirements are met:

1. Prior permission has been granted by the principal.
    A. If the course can be taken on campus, it is the preferred option.
    B. If the course cannot be taken during the regular school day, an LHS credit recovery
       option will be the next alternative.
    C. If neither a nor b is an option, outside providers may be considered for approval.
2. The course(s) fits the education plan developed for the student.
    Transfer students who (1) are seniors, (2) who have transferred from an accredited high
    school, and will only lack the additional 1/2 credit of Civics required at Laurel to graduate
    may request waiver of that 1/2 credit. The high school principal shall have the discretion to
    issue that waiver if in his/her judgment the student has not used the transfer to avoid taking
    the additional credit. Further, the student may be required to do makeup work for the part of
    the year missed in civics in order to insure success in the remainder of the course.

## POST-SECONDARY PLANNING

If you plan to continue your education beyond high school, know the entrance requirements of the
school of your choice, the date by which you must make application, the required tests, and when
you must take the tests. These plans are particularly important if your choice of schools is outside of
Montana. It will then be imperative that your four-year class program meets entrance requirements.
These can be easily checked by a counselor. Study the possibilities of financial aid. Continue your
exploration into the field of occupations and develop tentative goals that are in line with your
interests and abilities. A library of vocational and educational materials is available, and frequent use
of it is encouraged. Literature from all branches of the armed forces is available.

## SCHEDULE CHANGES

Laurel High School counselors work collaboratively with students as they plan a course of study that
fulfills the Laurel School District graduation requirements and prepares them for their post-high
school goals. This planning begins each winter when students, parents, teachers, and counselors
consider LHS classes and identify appropriate coursework for the next school year. Students are
given several weeks to look through the Curriculum Guide and ask questions of parents, teachers,
and counselors before making their final selections.

After the registration process has been completed, the LHS administration designs a complex
master schedule based on the courses students requested and registered for. Factors beyond the
control of Laurel High School such as budget decisions, legislation, and staffing needs and
availability also impact the master schedule and the courses being offered.

Because it is not possible to accommodate changing demands for classes once the master schedule
is created, it is expected that students honor the selections they made during registration. Students


have only the first 5 days of the semester to make schedule changes.
a. Students have only the first 5 days of the semester to make schedule changes.
b. Additionally, students are allowed to change their schedule one time after the initial
schedule is made.

**WHAT KIND OF SCHEDULE CHANGES CAN BE MADE**
Changes will be made to schedules ONLY if one or more of the following conditions exists:
● you are not scheduled for enough classes
● you have an unscheduled period and need to add a class or Study Hall
● you are in the wrong level of a class (e.g., should be in Spanish 11, scheduled for
Spanish I)
● you need a class required for graduation this year (SENIORS ONLY)
● you are scheduled in a class you have already passed
● you need to retake a required class that you did not pass
● you do not have the prerequisite for a class you are scheduled for
● you are scheduled for a class you completed in the summer
● you want to drop a class for a Study Hall
● you are retaking a failed class and scheduled with the same teacher
● you are scheduled for a Study Hall you didn't register for and want to add a class

All conflicts between a student and a teacher need to be resolved in a mature, professional manner.
If you have a conflict with a teacher, you and/or your parent or guardian should meet with the
teacher and work through the problem. If a resolution cannot be reached, then the parent or teacher
should contact an administrator to meet regarding the issues. If a class change is granted by the
administrator, the change will be based on space available and the least impact to your schedule.

Students who plan to attend post-secondary schools are advised to keep in mind the general college
entrance requirements and to select a high school program which will prepare them to meet more
than the minimum standards. The school counselor or principal should be consulted concerning
specific entrance qualifications and requirements.

**No one will be eligible to participate in graduation exercises unless all requirements are met
beforehand. In the case of dire circumstances one may seek an administrative exception
provided that student has begun his/her eighth semester of coursework and requests special
consideration preferably by March 1st of the spring in which the individual seeks to secure a
certificate of attendance rather than a diploma. See Board Policy #2333**


A foreign exchange student who through an approved CSIET program has completed a successful
year of attendance and is a student in good standing may choose to participate in commencement
ceremonies where he/she will receive a certificate of attendance.

A student who wishes to graduate early must secure permission and file a plan for early graduation
during his/her junior year of study. For details please visit with a counselor or administrator.

## GRADING SCALE

The following grading scale will be used in all high school courses.


A= 90-100
B = 80-89
C= 70-79
D = 65-69
F = 64 and below

## ACADEMIC LETTER

National Honor Society and Student Council have developed an academic letter which is awarded
for achieving honor roll grades on the semester honor roll. The academic letter was developed as
not only an award, but an incentive to keep grades up at an honor roll level.

## REPORT CARDS AND HONOR ROLL

Report cards are issued during the week following the end of each grading period. These grades are
issued to assist the student and the parents/guardians in determining the quality of work
accomplished. Students and parents/guardians should study these grades in order to make any
changes necessary in receiving the maximum benefits from the educational opportunities.

Those students having a 3.00 average in all academic subjects for any nine week period are listed
on the Honor Roll.

This average is computed by using the following formula:


Standard High School Courses
A= 4.00
B = 3.00
C = 2.00
D = 1.00
F = 0.00


Honors and AP Courses
A= 5.00
B = 4.00
C = 3.00
D = 2.00
F = 0.00

All grades are used when figuring the Honor Roll. The school administration office, the guidance
office, and the faculty stand ready at all times to discuss and advise needed steps for improvement.
We will do our best to keep the parent/guardian informed of the student's status.


## CLASS RANK

Students' class rank will be calculated as students' progress through their coursework. Individuals
who complete correspondence, Nova Net, or other courses honored by LHS will have the course
grades added to their transcript upon the closing of the next semester of study. The GPA from these
courses will be reflected in their on-going rank.

Final class rank will be reflective of the student's full course of study and will be posted on the final
transcript. Individuals who graduate early will be ranked with the next full graduating class. In other
words, a student who completes graduation requirements after a graduation ceremony will be
considered a member of the next graduation class and will be ranked accordingly.

Class ranking will reflect weighted grades when used for internal purposes. On occasion institutions
and scholarship guidelines will request unweighted transcripts. The counseling department will
generate both weighted and unweighted transcripts upon request a student who passes a course of
study and elects to repeat that course of study will only be awarded credit once unless that course
has been specifically recognized as a course eligible for multiple credits (see section on graduation
requirements). Upon completion of the course the second time, a student may petition the counselor
and principal for the higher of the two course grades to be calculated in the cumulative GPA. If a
student fails a course and retakes the course, both marks stand in the cumulative GPA calculation.

Valedictorian and Salutatorian honors will be based on highest cumulative grade point averages
based on full-time attendance and a weighted scale at the conclusion of seven semesters of course
study. Students receiving these honors must have been enrolled in an accredited high school, as
recognized by the state of Montana, for a minimum of three full academic years.

## GRADUATION ATTIRE

Graduation Ceremony Attire: Students are expected to dress business casual or semi-formal for the
formal occasion of graduation ceremony including the agreed upon Cap and Gown. Mortar boards
may be decorated according to the agreed upon expectations and guidelines. Decorated mortar
boards must have administrative approval three days before the ceremony. Students may wear
traditional American Indian tribal regalia or objects of cultural significance at public events including
but not limited to graduation ceremonies per Policy #2333.

## PROGRESS REPORTS AND HOMEWORK ACCESS

Progress reports will be available for each student approximately 4 weeks after the start of each
quarter. Student report cards, homework and assignments from each teacher are available on the
High School Website at [http://www.laurel.k12.mt.us.](http://www.laurel.k12.mt.us.) Report cards will be shared in the following manner
with students, parent/guardians: Mid-Term via Infinite Campus Portal (no paper copies); Quarter via
paper copy to student; Semester report card mailed home. Both students and parents are provided
with access to student information through the Infinite Campus portal. If you need user ID or
password assistance please contact the district administration office.

## FAMILY NIGHT

Family Night will be observed in the district on Wednesday every week. The following guidelines are


applicable:
-No scheduled activities after 6:00 P.M.
-Homework or tests cannot be assigned on Wednesday due on Thursday

he/she will receive an excuse from the school office for one (I) day only. Any excuse beyond this
time limit must come from a doctor. It is the parent/guardian responsibility to get this checked and
the excuse delivered to the proper personnel at the school.

Any student in grades nine through twelve who has a medical release from a doctor will not
participate in any physical education activity until the doctor supplies written permission for him/her
to continue in the P.E. activity. It is the parent/guardian responsibility to obtain this written
permission. The student will be required to satisfactorily complete written assignments or perform
other non-participating activities as required by the teacher to earn a passing grade.

## MUSIC

It shall be the policy of this school district to require all students using school-owned instruments to
pay a rental fee for the school year, all fees payable in advance. Such fee shall be for a nine (9)
month school year, with a lesser fee to be assessed for the summer program. In the case of proven
financial hardship, the Band Director and the Superintendent may make arrangements so that no
one shall be deprived of an opportunity to participate. Refunds will be made only to students who are
transferring to another school; such refunds to be made on a percentage basis depending on the
condition of the returned instrument. All funds received from rentals will be used for instrument
repairs.

Any student wishing to become a member of the music groups should contact the instructor and
arrange for a tryout.

Once a student becomes a member of a music group, he/she is expected to observe the same rules
as listed for all classes. He/she is also expected to be available for all outside performances.

## POLICY FOR SCHOOL RELATED COLLEGE AND CAREER VISITS

1. Juniors and Seniors are allowed two (2) visitation days per semester
2. Student must fill out an application form prior to leaving

    requirements as they apply for extracurricular activities and meet the entrance requirements
    of the school they are visiting.
4. Homework should be made up as determined by the instructor
5. **Proof of visitation is required (i.e. a letter with college/military/career letterhead with**
    **official signature and phone number)**

If a student chooses to abuse these privileges, they will be counted as an absence and all remaining
college/career visits will be revoked for the year.

## SCHOLARSHIPS AND AWARDS

A number of scholarships and other forms of financial aid are available for your post-secondary
education. If you are interested, please check at the guidance office.


## HEALTH SERVICES

If a student has health-related problems he/she would like to discuss with the school nurse, she
welcomes the opportunity to be of service. The student may make an appointment directly with her
at her office or through the secretary or counselor. The nurse's office is located next to the
counselor's office. She is at the High School one day a week, usually on Tuesday.

The school nurse informs teachers about students with health needs and how to make
accommodations in the classroom if necessary.

High School students are allowed to bring one dose of a prescription medication to school to be
self-administered during the day. Designated school personnel may, only upon written request from
parents/guardians and written direction from a physician/dentist, accept and store prescription
medicine from students. The school must receive such medicine in a properly labeled container. It is
then the student's responsibility to come to the office to take the medicine. A parent medication
consent form is available at the office or on the school website. Go to "Departments", then "Student
Health" and click on the medication consent form.

Students who receive immunizations should bring documentation to the school nurse so the
information can be entered on the individual State of Montana Immunization record. A copy of this
immunization record will be sent home for senior students at the beginning of the 2nd semester to be
used for post-secondary or job applications.

The school nurse will do vision and blood pressure screening for new students and upon request by
students, parents/guardians, or teachers.

Hearing screening is conducted at your child's school. Pure tone screening is mandated for students
in grades K, 1, and 10. Students in other grades will also be screened if they are new to the school,
on the annual hearing recheck screening, or does not pass the pure tone screening, they will be
referred for a hearing rescreen. The Hearing Conservation Program audiologist will conduct the
hearing rescreen and, in addition to the pure tone screening, may also conduct one or both of the
following: Optoacoustic Emissions (OAES) Screening, which is a measure of cochlear (inner ear)
function that does not require the child to respond and/or Emittance Screening, which measures the
movement of the eardrum by putting positive and negative air pressure in to the ear canal.

## MEDICATION AT SCHOOL

Designated school personnel may, only upon written request from parents/guardians and written
direction from a physician/dentist, accept and store prescription medicine for students. The school
must receive such medicine in a properly labeled container. No more than a daily dosage of a
prescription drug should be brought to school. Students are responsible for self-administration of
medications.

## RESPONSIBLE USE POLICY FOR TECHNOLOGY/INTERNET/ELECTRONIC RESOURCES

Laurel High School strongly believes in the educational value of technology and electronic services
and recognizes the potential of such to support our curriculum and student learning. The use of
technology and information systems is a privilege not a right.

**Responsible Use:** Individual users of the districtcomputer networks are responsible for their
behavior and communications over those networks. Users will comply with the district standards.
The use of the Internet and electronic resources must be in support of educational research and the
educational goals and objectives of Laurel High School. Network storage areas may be treated like
school lockers. Network managers may review files and communications to maintain system integrity
and insure that users are using the system responsibly. Users should recognize that files stored on
district computer systems are NOT private.

Within reason, freedom of speech and access to information will be honored. During school hours,
teachers will guide students toward appropriate use of technology resource and the Internet. Outside
of school, parents/guardians bear the same responsibility for such guidance as they exercise with
information sources such as television, movies, and other potentially offensive media.

**Privileges** : The use of the District's electronic networksis a privilege, not a right, and inappropriate
use will result in a cancellation of those privileges. The system administrator (and/or building
principal) will make all decisions regarding whether or not a user has violated these procedures and
may deny, revoke, or suspend access at any time. His or her decision is final. Consequences of


misuse of these resources, depending upon the severity of the situation may include one or more of
the following:

- A warning followed by re-clarification of the appropriate use guidelines.
- Loss of access to District technology resources.
- Notification of parents/guardians and administrators by phone or personal conference.
- Referral to proper authorities for disciplinary and/or legal action.
- Students who have lost Internet or network privileges may not use personal equipment in lieu
    of district or school equipment.
**Unacceptable Use:** The user is responsible for hisor her actions and activities involving the
network. Some examples of unacceptable uses are:
- Using the network for any illegal activity, including violations of copyright or other contracts,
or transmitting any material in violation of any United States or Montana law;
- Unauthorized downloading of software, regardless of whether it is copyrighted or reversed;
- Downloading copyrighted material for other than personal use;
- Using the network for private financial or commercial gain;
- Wastefully using resources, such as file space;
- Hacking or gaining unauthorized access to files, resources, or entities;
- Invading the privacy ofindividuals, which includes the unauthorized disclosure,
dissemination, and use of information or a personal nature about anyone;
- Using another user's account or password
- Posting material authorized or created by another, without his/her consent;
- Posting anonymous messages;
- Using the network for commercial or private advertising;
- Accessing, submitting, posting, publishing, or displaying any defamatory, inaccurate,
abusive, obscene, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, racially offensive, harassing, or
illegal material; and
- Using the network while access privileges are suspended or revoked.
- Online shopping;
- Chatting or using chat lines for other than educational purposes;
- Playing games without teacher approval;
- Printing for other than educational purposes

**Network Etiquette:** The user is expected to abide bythe generally accepted rules of network
etiquette. These include, but are not limited to:

- Be polite. Do not become abusive in messages to others.
- Use appropriate language, do not swear or use vulgarities or any other inappropriate
    language.
- Do not reveal personal information, including the addresses or telephone numbers, of
    students or teachers.
- Recognize that electronic mail (e-mail) is not private. People who operate the system have
    access to all mail. Messages relating to or in support of illegal activities may be reported to
    the authorities.
- Do not use the network in any way that would disrupt its use by other users.
- Consider all communications and information accessible via the network not to be private
    property.

**No Warranties:** The District makes no warranties ofany kind, whether expressed or implied, for the
services it is providing.

**Indemnification** : The user agrees to indemnify theDistrict for any losses, costs or damages,


including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by the District, relating to or arising out of any violation
of these procedures.

**Security** : Network security is a high priority. Ifthe user can identify a security problem on the
Internet, the user must notify the system administrator or building principal.

**Vandalism** : Vandalism will result in cancellation ofprivileges and other disciplinary action.
Vandalism is defined as any malicious attempt to harm or destroy data of another user, the Internet,
or any other network. This includes, but not limited to, the uploading or creation of viruses.

**Telephone Charges** : The District assumes no responsibilityfor any unauthorized charges or fees,
including telephone charges, long-distance charges, per-minute surcharges, and/or equipment or
line charges.

**Copyright Web Publishing Rules** : Copyright law andDistrict policy prohibit the republishing of text
or graphics found on the Web or on District Websites or file servers, without explicit written
permission.

- For each republication (on a Website or file server) of a graphic or text file that was produced
    externally, there must be a notice at the bottom of the page crediting the original producer
    and noting how and when permission was granted.
- Students and staff engaged in producing Web pages must provide library media specialists
    with e-mail or hard copy permissions before the Web pages are published.
- The absence of a copyright notice may not be interpreted as permission to copy the
    materials.
- The "fair use" rules governing student reports in classrooms are less stringent and permit
    limited use of graphics and text.
- Student work may only be published if there is written permission from both the
    parent/guardian and the student.

**Behavioral Expectations**
The Laurel School District believes in a positive approach to supporting students in developing a
healthy, well-balanced way of life.

**Student Infractions**
It is our responsibility to teach students social skills which will allow them to be successful not only
as a young person but as an adult. Teachers are expected to use proactive teaching skills to redirect
the student; however, if the student does not make the choice to correct their behavior, they will
receive an office referral.

If a student's actions require an out-of-school suspension (OSS), parents will be notified in writing.
Parents/guardians will have complete custody and jurisdiction of their child during the suspension.
Students must complete schoolwork during their suspension. Schoolwork for out-of-school
suspensions will be assigned by administration through the office. If students need assistance while
completing the work, it is the family's responsibility to contact administration so arrangements can be
made to provide assistance.

A student who is suspended cannot be on any Laurel School District property or at any District
sponsored activities during the suspension time. If a student is directed by administration to be on
school grounds for academic assistance all necessary parties will be notified.

locating your child should he/she be reported to law enforcement as missing. No other
use by OPI or law enforcement is permitted. Access by OPI staff will be strictly limited
and controlled to staff or contractors creating and maintaining the repository.
