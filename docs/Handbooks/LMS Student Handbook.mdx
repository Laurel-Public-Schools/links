**THIS HANDBOOK IS NOT MEANT TO BE ALL INCLUSIVE. ADMINISTRATIVE RULES, SCHOOL
BOARD POLICY, STATE LAW, AND CLASSROOM RULES ALSO APPLY.**

Please read the handbook carefully. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to stop by the
school office. The school office is open from 8:00-4:00 every day school is in session, and you are

### MISSION STATEMENT

**The Laurel School District is dedicated to the individual development
of each student every day, without exception.
Goal**
The Laurel School District’s goal is to carry out the mission by providing an academically enriching
school experience, promoting social, physical and technological skills, and implementing the seven
Correlates of the Effective Schools Model at all levels of decision making.

- Learning for All
- Safe and Orderly Environment
- Academic Time on Task
- Positive Home and School Relations
- Frequent Monitoring of Student Progress
- Strong Instructional Leadership
- High Expectations for Students, Staff and Community
The seven Correlates of Effective Schools fits into the three district level goal areas of
implementation of the Common Core, Academic Achievement, and Safe and Orderly Environment.

### PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE

Montana law now requires that the pledge of allegiance be recited in all public schools in the state.
The pledge must be conducted at the beginning of the first class of each school day in kindergarten
through sixth grade and at the beginning of each week in grades 7 through 12. Building principals
will determine the best method to accomplish this requirement.

Any student or teacher who for any reason objects to participating in the pledge exercise must be
excused from participation. A student or teacher who declines to participate in the pledge may
engage in any alternative form of conduct so long as that conduct does not materially or substantially
disrupt the work or discipline of the school.

Further, if a student or teacher declines to participate in the recitation of the pledge pursuant to this
section, a school district may not for evaluation purposes include any reference to the student's or
teacher's not participating.

## VISITORS

In accordance with District Policy #4320, students are entrusted to the schools for educational
purposes. School officials must not assume license to allow unapproved contact with students by
persons not employed by the District for educational purposes. Although guest speakers are
allowed at the discretion of administrators, the District normally does not permit contact by
non-school personnel. The District will not allow access to the schools by outside organizations
desiring to use the captive audience in a school for information, sales material, or special interest
purposes.

Parents and guardians desiring to visit the school prior to enrollment may do so with approval from
administration. Such visitation must be prearranged. Parents and guardians desiring to attend
classes during the school day may be allowed to do so with prior notice and approval from
administration.

Parents, guardians, and other visitors (approved by parents/guardians) wishing to eat lunch with
children may check them out through the front office and take them off-campus to eat during the
lunch period.


## CONTROLLED CAMPUS

1. All students, except those that have a complete Off Campus Permission Form on file in the
    office from parents, will remain on the school grounds from the time they arrive at school in
    the morning until they are dismissed at the end of the school day. Bus students will remain
    on the school grounds until they board the bus.
2. Students must have permission from the office before leaving the campus any time before
    school is dismissed.
3. After school is dismissed until the buses arrive, students may remain on school grounds only
    if they are riding the bus, have an athletic practice that starts right after school or are working
    with an adult. Students not riding buses need to leave school grounds after the dismissal
    bell.

## CLOSING OF SCHOOL

In case it should be necessary to close school due to bad weather, failure of the heating system or
some similar case, arrangements will be made to broadcast such a notice over radio stations in
Laurel and Billings between 7:00a.m. & 8:00 a.m.

## MIDDLE SCHOOL CLUBS

The Board recognizes that student clubs are helpful resources for schools and supports their
formation. The middle school administration is delegated to approve or deny club applications.
Student clubs must complete an application process. All Clubs are student driven and staff serves as
a supervisor only. Parent permission slip is required before a student can attend any club meetings.

## FAMILY NIGHT

Family Night will be observed in the district on Wednesday every week. The following are
applicable:


● No scheduled activities after 6:00 p.m.
● Homework or tests cannot be assigned on Wednesday due on Thursday.
● Homework or tests can be assigned earlier in the week due on Thursday.


## RELEASE OF STUDENT DIRECTORY INFORMATION

Information considered as student directory information may be released without written consent.
The following information will be released to the proper agencies as the need arises: student’s name,
address, telephone number, date and place of birth, participation in officially recognized activities
and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, awards received,
and most recent previous school attended by the student. If individuals do not want this information
released, they must request that the school remove the student from the directory listing.

## MISSING CHILD PHOTO REPOSITORY

The repository is authorized by Montana Code Annotated (20-7-1317, MCA) and
requires the Montana Office of Public Instruction (OPI) to create and maintain an
electronic directory photograph repository of all Montana students for the exclusive
purpose of locating missing school-age children. The repository provides immediate and
24/7 year-round access to a child's school directory photograph to law enforcement
should a child be reported missing. Annually, districts must provide parents and
guardians notice of the repository and a form to opt -in their student(s).

### Who will have access to my child's photograph in the photo repository?
your child's photograph will only be used by law enforcement for the express purpose of
locating your child should he/she be reported to law enforcement as missing. No other
use by OPI or law enforcement is permitted. Access by OPI staff will be strictly limited
and controlled to staff or contractors creating and maintaining the repository.

### How do I remove my child's photograph from the photograph repository?
A parent can opt-out at any time. Contact your school/district to request your child's
photograph be removed.

## EQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY, NONDISCRIMINATION, AND SEX EQUITY

The District will make equal educational opportunities available for all students without regard to
race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, ethnicity, language barrier, religious belief, physical or
mental handicap or disability, economic or social condition, actual or potential marital or parental
status. No student will be denied equal access to programs, activities, services, or benefits or be
limited in the exercise of any right, privilege, or advantage, or denied equal access to educational
and extracurricular programs and activities.

telephone in any classroom or the school office. Parents or guardians are asked not to call students
at school except in case of an emergency. School staff will take messages to be delivered to
students but will not put calls through to classrooms.

## MOVING OR WITHDRAWING FROM ENROLLMENT IN THIS SCHOOL

Please promptly report in writing any change of address and/or telephone number to the school
office. Print your full name and your new address and/or phone number and give this information to
the secretary. If you and your family are about to move beyond the area served by this school, or if
for any other reason you must withdraw from enrollment, bring a note to the school office from your
parents or guardians stating this fact in advance of your withdrawal. You will then receive a drop
sheet which you will take to be signed by the librarian, the counselor, and each of your teachers.
When the sheet has been signed by them and all books have been checked in, return the sheet to
the school office. Any fines you may owe or refunds due to you should be settled at this time, and
you will be checked out.

## SENSITIVE TOPICS

Policy #2335 states: Health, family life, and sex education, including information about parts of the
body, reproduction, and related topics, will be included in the instructional program as appropriate to
grade level and course of study. (Lines 7-9) In accordance with Board policy, parents may ask to
review materials to be used and may request that their child be excluded from sex education class
session without prejudice. (Lines 10-12).

at the school office.

## ATTENDANCE

ATTENDANCE POLICY
The State of Montana has made education compulsory for all children from the ages of 7 to 16 years
of age. Therefore, absence from school without adequate reason is illegal and parents are in
violation of the law. Attendance in all classes by students enrolled in Laurel Middle School is
expected, and students are responsible for being in class on time, prepared to learn.

Any time you leave the building, you must:

1. **Have permission from your parent or guardianbeforeyou leave** – Students must be
    signed out through the office and will only be released to an authorized parent or
    guardian. Students will not be released to persons not listed on their contacts OR to
    minor siblings with prior written permission, email or phone call from a parent or
    guardian.
2. Check out with the secretaries in the office. **Failureto check out properly through the**
    **office will be considered an absence and/or truancy.**

### ATTENDANCE PHILOSOPHY

Since attendance in school is paramount to realizing the utmost of one’s education, the school
district will utilize every effort to keep students in school. The intent of the 10-day rule is to stress to
students and parents the importance of class attendance and to provide for greater student
accountability, not to punish students who have legitimate absences approved beforehand. This
attendance criterion is based on the theory that prompt and regular attendance in school is the
beginning of dependability in adult, business, personal, and social life. Furthermore, regular
attendance is important because valuable skills and information gained in the classroom, may or
may not show up on tests, or be reflected in an academic grade.

The process of education includes a combination of instruction, classroom participation, learning
experiences, and study in order to achieve the maximum educational benefits for each individual
student. The regular contact of the students with one another in the classroom and their participation
in instructional activities under the tutelage of a competent teacher are vital to this purpose. This is
an established principle of education which underlies and gives purpose to the requirement of


compulsory schooling in this and every other state in the nation. The good things that schools have
to offer can only be presented to students who are in attendance. Having established the importance
of regular attendance as a base for a good education, we must consider the rights and
responsibilities of students, parents/guardians, and teachers in regard to this attendance philosophy.

Students have a right to be involved in a meaningful program when in attendance at school. They
will be expected to make up work when absent. At the same time, students have the responsibility
to comply with school attendance rules and to make a reasonable effort to progress in the school
program.

Parents/guardians are to keep the school informed of their child’s absence. They also have the right
to keep the student out of school for illness or other valid reasons. Parents/guardians are expected
to comply with state and local school laws regarding school attendance. Parents/guardians will be
kept informed of their child’s absence.

**Parents/guardians are urged to arrange physicals, picture appointments, doctor and dental
appointments, etc. on Wednesdays (late afternoon due to Early Outs), on weekends, during
the summer, or during school holidays in order to minimize the loss of school time.**

Teachers have a right to expect regular attendance from their students. Teachers shall assist
students with makeup work.

### ATTENDANCE: 10 DAY RULE

1. A student will be allowed ten (10) absences per class, per semester.


An absence is any time the student is not physically present in class.


Students who are absent will be required to make up work missed and to receive grades for
time absent. The responsibility of contacting the instructors, getting assignments, doing the
work, and submitting it to the instructor rests with the student.


If a student is to be absent, the parent/guardian must call the school at any time to leave a
message, or send a note to notify the school of the absence. The phone number is
628-3900. If the parent/guardian does not call, the District personnel will make every effort
to call the home when an absence has occurred.

2. The following are the ONLY absences that WILL NOT be used in calculating the attendance
    record:
    A. Those that occur due to school-sponsored activities, since these are considered an
       equivalent educational experience. These exemptions will apply to students participating
       in sports events, music related events, academic field trips, and others deemed
       co-curricular.
    B. Bereavement in the immediate family (grandmother, grandfather, father, mother, sister,
       brother). Parent/guardians must notify the school. Any extended bereavement may be
       reviewed by the administration.
    C. Subpoenas to appear in court or court-ordered, out-of-district placements for special
       services; and
    D. Long-term illness and/or hospitalization verified by a doctor’s statement. Medical/dental
       appointments also need to be verified by a doctor’s statement. Doctor’s notes must be
       provided in a timely fashion within two days of the return of an absence that exceeds the

### ATTENDANCE POLICY

**3. Absences that will be counted in the ten (10) day limit include such things as:**



Suspension in and out of school, illness, family trips, vacations, visiting friends or relatives,
skiing, hunting, attending concerts, shopping, or any others not covered in section 2.

4. **After seven (7) absences from school/class** a letterwill be sent to the student’s home,
    indicating the school policy and a notice for the student and parent/guardian to contact
    school officials and meet with school administration and other relevant individuals as
    necessary to discuss the severity of the situation. Interventions and assistance will be
    offered.
5. **On the tenth (10) absence, the proper legal authorities will be notified**. The School
    Resource Officer may deliver the ten-day letter to the student’s home.

### TARDIES

Students are expected to be to class on time as late arrivals create a disruption to the learning
environment. A student is tardy when he/she is not physically in the classroom at the time the bell
rings. Tardies will be enforced on a quarterly basis. **If a student is tardy beyond 10 minutes, the
tardy becomes an absence**. Excessive tardiness willbe handled according to the grid in the
discipline/consequence section of this handbook.

### ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION

Students absent during the day and/or part of the day of an activity or practice will not be permitted
to participate in that event. If a student is absent the afternoon before a weekend or holiday, they
may be permitted to take part in the activity during that weekend or holiday with the consent of the
parent/guardian, the administration, and the head coach or group advisor of the event. On overnight
trips when the team leaves before a holiday, students who are absent on the day before may not be
allowed to accompany the team. Approval for participation will be considered if the absence in
question results from a previously scheduled medical/dental appointment, an appointment that
satisfies the requirements of the law, attendance at a school related activity, or if the absence results
from some family emergency as deemed excusable by the coaches and/or administration. A student
will not be excused from assigned detention time or Saturday School for a practice or school activity.
This policy does not apply to band and choir concerts as they are a required part of the curriculum.

### ADVANCED ABSENTEE

Students who know in advance that they will be absent from school must complete an Advanced
Absentee Form. If the absence is due to a school related activity, the work from the class the student
is missing is up to the student to complete by the next school day. Students on the ICU list may not
be allowed to participate in school related activities as their Advanced Absentee Forms will not be
completed. Coaches and advisors will submit a list of participants and the completed forms to the
office.

Advanced absentee forms will also be available when students will be absent for planned family
activities such as family trips, etc. The expectation is that the work will be completed once you return
or as arranged by each individual teacher.

### GETTING ASSIGNMENTS DURING AN ILLNESS

Students and parents are encouraged to either email teachers or access assignments through
Google classroom. Teachers will be notified of school related activities that take place during the
school day. If a child is on ICU he/she will not be able to participate in the school event if it is not
deemed an educational activity. Use the school website or Google Classroom to access
assignments whenever a student is absent. Students absent for one day should obtain make-up
homework assignments form their individual homework notebooks, fellow students, middle school
website (www.laurel.k12.mt.us) and/or the individual teachers. When a student has been absent for


two or more consecutive days, parents/guardians who are unable to access the website may request
that the office prepare a detailed make-up list for their student. To do this, parents/guardians should
call the school office before 9:00 A.M. on the day they wish to pick up the assignment list. The list
will be available between 3:30 and 4:00 on the same day. Students will have two days for every day
absent up to two weekends for absences over three or more consecutive days.

Students will be placed on ICU when they are absent for an assignment. This is just a
communication tool for parents and students on what is missing. They will not miss any activities due
to being on ICU for this unless it becomes past the two days for every absence or beyond the two
weekends for long absences.

## SUPERVISION OF STUDENTS

The hallways of the school do not officially open until 8:00 each morning. There will be supervision
outside and in the cafeteria starting at 7:30. Only students eating breakfast can be in the cafeteria
between 7:30-8:00. Once the students are done eating they will be asked to go outside. At 8:00 AM
all wing doors will be opened to allow students in. Children arriving at school prior to 7:30 are left
unsupervised. Students are required to remain outside on the playground until 8:00 when they will
enter the building through their wing doors; classes begin at 8:05. Breakfast is served at 7:30 each
day. Students eating breakfast are welcome in the Commons of Laurel Middle School at that time,

## but not before. Students who are NOT eating breakfastmust remain outside until

## 8:00. If your children are planning to work with ateacher or attend the homework room prior to 8:00,

please ask that they make appointments with the teacher and secure a pass from the teacher. If your
child is attending the homework room, he/she may enter through the library doors at 7:30.

Students are asked to leave school grounds after school. They are not to remain in the commons or
hallways unsupervised. If they need to stay on campus, the homework room will be open until 4:30,
or they can make an appointment to work with a teacher.

## PICK UP AND DROP OFF PROCEDURES

· **WALKERS OR BIKE RIDERS:** All students thatare walking home need to leave from the

wing doors at their grade level hallways. Once they are outside,they need to leave the campus

immediately and start heading home. We do not haveenough supervision to keep watch on 700

kids throughout our large campus.

· **STUDENTS BEING PICKED UP:** Students who arebeing picked upneed to leave from

the main office door or the north door. If a parentis not already legally parked on the west side

of the school, then the student will go to the sidewalk of the main parking lot and remain there

until their ride arrives. All students that are waiting for pick up need to be picked up from the

sidewalk of the main parking lot. This alleviates the possibility of students running in front of cars

and buses to reach their ride.

****If you are picking up or dropping off your students please do not pick up or drop off**

**using the bus lane.**

****The East Parking lot is not to be used for picking up and dropping off as well. This is**

**dangerous driving into this lot and picking up kids. Please do all pickups on the West**

**side of the building.**

o _Good Rule of thumb: if you do not get a legalparking spot on the west side of the school_

_before school is let out, you will need to pick up your student in the main parking lot._


o _I know this isn’t ideal and can be more time consuming, but having kids running in front of_

_buses, between cars, and in front of cars, as well as scattered throughout the campus, is not_

_safe and someone can potentially get hurt._

o _Students being picked up need to wait for parentson the sidewalk of the main parking lot._

_They are not to be intermixed with the bus students in the commons area._

o _During parent pick up, please be prompt and patient._

· **BUS STUDENTS:** All bus students will sitin the commons area until their bus is called

out. Once their bus is called they will walk out the main office doors to their bus. All bus students

are to exit from the main office door.

## CAFETERIA

Cafeteria facilities are available for all Middle School students. Lunches are $3.00 daily, per student.
Breakfast is also available for $1.50 and extra milk for $.75. Each student will be issued an account
number. Certain ala-cart items are available such as chips and juice. These are available at an extra
charge not included in lunch prices.


Paying for Lunch


● Bring checks for meal accounts to the office in the morning before your first class in the
building to be deposited in your personal account. Online payment is available. Any
amount may be deposited into a student’s lunch account. Parents are encouraged to
plan approximately $60.00 per month for full priced meals, lunch only, and additional
amounts if the student plans to eat breakfast and/or have extra milk. Make checks
payable to LMS (Laurel Middle School) Lunch Program. The full amount of the check or
currency will be deposited in the student’s personal lunch account. It will not be possible
to give change from currency or checks. If sending cash with your student, please send a
note along verifying the amount you send with your child. No cash or check will be
accepted in the lunch line.
● Money for extra milk or milk purchased to drink with a sack lunch must also be brought to
the office in the morning before the first class to be deposited in your personal account.
No cash will be paid in the lunch line.
● Charges will not be allowed on accounts showing a negative balance larger than $25.00.
Students will not be allowed to eat school lunch until the balance is paid. Students are
expected to watch their account balance and notify parents or guardians when a deposit
to their account is needed.
● Students on free or reduced lunch will not be allowed to charge extra milk unless money
is deposited to their account to cover that cost.


Lunch Line Procedure


● Students will swipe their card for their purchases or enter their student ID numbers.
● Once students are in the lunch line, if they leave for any reason, then they must go to the
end of the line.
● To be as efficient as possible, students that do not have a card will go to the back of the line.
Students with cards will go to the front.



● If you student lost their card, it is $5 for a replacement card. Please bring the money to the
Middle School office and the secretary will get a replacement.


Lunchroom


● All students are expected to be orderly, neat, and considerate of others while eating in the
cafeteria. A good general guideline is to always be respectful, responsible, and safe. The
following actions are violations of lunchroom rules and will result in disciplinary action.
● Food deliveries are permitted by parents only.
● Throwing food or other objects.

## ASSIGNMENTS & ICU

### EXTRA PRACTICE

An important thing to remember: IT IS EASIER TO KEEP UP THAN TO CATCH UP. A certain
amount of study is usually required daily in most classes. If students use their time well, many
assignments can be completed during class instead of as extra practice (commonly referred to as
homework). It is recommended that parents or guardians who wish to keep abreast of their child’s
study progress use the following plan:

1. The student writes all assignments for each day in his/her assignment book. Write down “no
    assignment” if there is no homework.
2. The student obtains each teacher’s initials or stamp indicating that the assignment the
    student copied is correct.
3. Any assignments started or completed during school are taken home for the parents’ or
    guardians’ appraisal.
4. The student takes home all needed notes, textbooks, and materials to complete
    assignments.
5. The amount of responsibility placed on the student should be gradually increased.
6. Parents/Guardians can check students’ grades and assignment progress using Infinite
    Campus. Contact the main office at 628-3900 to learn how.

The purpose for an extra practice policy is to support and promote the efforts of teaching and
learning in the school and at home. In keeping with the Power of ICU, the policy is developed with
the desire to:

1. Reinforce concepts taught and learned in the classroom.
2. Encourage extra practice as an extension of the classroom work.
3. Prepare students for upcoming material.

We believe that the academic success of students is dependent on the efforts of teachers, students,
and parents. We ask parents to communicate with the child on a regular basis about homework. We
also encourage parents/guardians to regularly communicate with the teachers to ensure their child is
completing assigned work via teachers email or phone.


### STUDY AND ICU RESCUE ROOM

In the attempt to support students in completing all of their extra practice, there will be opportunities
for your child to get the support necessary to be successful. Here are the times the Rescue Room
will be available to support students.


● Lunch
● Early Outs 2:30-4:30
● After School 3:30-4:30
● Saturdays 8:00-12:00

Teachers will be giving out quality assignments for students to get the extra practice necessary for
students to excel in the standard being taught. Students will be expected to hand in high quality
work. If work is not done to the quality the teacher has outlined then students can be put on ICU.

If their name is on the ICU list they will have to attend the lunch “Rescue Room” session.

Below is what to expect if an assignment is not completed or done to the quality the teacher has
outlined.


● 1-2 Assignments: Email and text messages notifies parents. Students attend Lunch Rescue
and to get extra time and support. Morning and Afterschool Rescue is applied if needed.
● 3-4 Assignments: Personal contact is made with parents to ensure contact information is
accurate.
● 5+ Assignments: The student is scheduled for after school Rescue as well as early out
Rescue, possible Saturday ICU.

The purpose of assigned work is to support and promote learning. Our goal is to have all students
complete and turn in their assignments. We believe that the academic success of students is
dependent on the efforts of teachers, students, and parents.

Students in need of academic support, as determined by the teacher or student, may be required to
attend the ICU Rescue Room during lunch to make up work on time to be successful academically.
Upon request or approval by the parent/guardian and school personnel, a student may be placed in
the after school Rescue Room. Students are required to bring their materials, assignments, and a
reading book to the after school Homework Room each day.

The Student grade should represent the students knowledge of the Standard. The total grade will be
reflected by the students assessment. Only up to 20% of the total grade will be on assignments.
However, the student will be responsible for turning in 100% of all extra practice.


● Tests->
○ Students that received less than 70% on a test will be put on ICU and must retake
the test. Students will be able to retake the test one time, teacher discretion for 3rd
attempt.
○ Student's that received 70% or higher may retake the test, but it will be based on
teacher discretion. Test needs to be taken within one week of test being returned and
must make arrangements with the teacher.
■ Before Retaking the test the student must complete at least two 15 minute
study sessions that need to be signed by the teacher or parent/guardian.
■ Retaking the test should be done within one week of when the original test
was given.



■ After 2nd retake and the student still hasn't reached above the 70%. Teacher
discretion for additional retakes. Students and teachers will have to make
arrangements to make sure students are ready to take the test again.
● Assignments
○ Assignments are important for the teacher and the students. The assignments are
formative assessments that both parties use to find misconceptions or mastery with
the standard before the summative assessment is given. All assignments need to be
completed.
○ Points may be taken off for late assignments

### MUST PASS POLICY

We believe that all children can learn and be successful in the school. We believe that responsibility
and accountability are life skills and that students can learn the importance of long range planning,
organization, goal setting, and time management.

We believe that our students should be held accountable for meeting or exceeding the standards of
learning established by the district. While we make modifications and accommodations as
appropriate, each student must demonstrate his or her knowledge of the skills, content, and
concepts in an appropriate high-quality manner. We have established the following expectations and
criteria to facilitate students’ continual progress in their academic knowledge, skills, and
development. We pledge our time, energy, and resources to support students in meeting these
goals.

In order for students to earn passing grades in their classes, they must complete the coursework
assigned to them to a level of proficiency determined by the teacher. It is our belief that ALL
students can learn and that ALL students have the capacity to do appropriate assignments in the
learning process.

“ICU stands for Intensive Care Unit, just like the hospital. ICU is a communication tool, a shared,
school-wide document that tracks missing student assignments. The document helps teachers and
administrators communicate with each other as well as with the students and parents. Students
learn quickly that if they have one missing assignment, their grade is sick and needs attention.”

## FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION!


Laurel Middle School is declaring war on student apathy!

### POWER OF ICU

The mission of ICU is to defeat student apathy through a culture where mastery, completion, and
accountability are the standards for learning.


✔ Every student completes every assignment
✔ Mandatory extra time/help for all students
✔ Transformation of student grades to reflect learning

Components:

- Immediate parent notification of missing assignments
- ICU List shared school wide
- Rescue= extra time before school, during lunch, after school, and during WIN time


- Lifeguard meeting each day to remind children of missing assignments

### POWER OF ICU FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

1. **Why is it called Power of ICU?**
    If children are not completing assignments, their learning, and possibly their grades, are in
    the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and are in need of life support. The name itself, ICU, speaks to
    the fact that those of us who are involved and invested in each child’s learning and academic
    success will be there to throw him/her a lifeline and provide the extra help and support that is
    needed.
2. **What is extra practice for learning?**
    Instead of using the terminology of “homework”, our staff is intentionally making the shift of
    calling assignments “extra practice for learning”. While this may seem like word semantics,
    the meaning behind it is important. We are striving to assign high quality extra practice so
    that students learn the standards. We practice for sports, music, and anything else we want
    to be good at. It makes sense that we would practice for learning, too.
3. **How do the text and email notifications work?**
    If your child has a missing or incomplete extra practice they are put on the ICU list and you
    will be notified by a text message and an email. Each missing or incomplete extra practice
    put on the list will send a separate text and email notification. The email notification will
    provide a more detailed description of the extra practice as well as a suggested intervention
    for your child to successfully complete the extra practice. When your child has completed
    and turned in a missing or incomplete practice that is on the list, you will receive an
    additional email notification letting you know that the assignment has been completed. This
    process is essential to the success of ICU and provides you with valuable, detailed, and
    up-to-date information regarding your child’s academic progress. To ensure that you are
    receiving these notifications, please make sure that your contact information is up to date. If
    you wish to modify or change the email address and/or phone number that the ICU
    notifications are sent to, please contact us. We would be happy to make those changes.
4. **How does ICU affect my child’s grades?**
    ICU will most likely have a positive effect on your child’s grades. Grades should reflect a
    child’s progress toward learning the standards. In order to ensure that learning is reflected in
    grades, we are basing grades on extra practice and assessments. In the past, grades have
    included everything from responsibility to cooperation; now, we want to ensure that your
    child’s grades communicate exactly what they know in relation to the standards. Additionally,
    time is a variable in learning. As we all know, children learn at different rates. Some children
    grasp concepts quickly and easily while others have to work harder to learn new material.
    Instead of penalizing students who take longer to learn, we simply want to celebrate every
    child’s efforts to learn the standards.
5. **How does ICU help your child learn?**
    ICU has made a significant difference in making learning a priority at Laurel Middle School.
    ICU helps your child learn by holding him/her accountable to completing the extra practice
    for learning. It is a systematic approach that no longer makes learning optional. In the past,
    some students may have chosen to avoid opportunities to learn, passively accepting ongoing
    failure. Now, all students are held accountable to learn, and children are no longer slipping
    through the cracks.
6. **What if my child is on the ICU list?**
    If your child is on the ICU list, we have a plan for helping him/her get the extra time and extra
    support needed. Generally speaking, we would provide more time during the school day, and
    make sure your child has any resources needed to complete the extra practice. Occasionally,



students are missing several extra practices at one time; we have a plan for that too! The
following plan can be flexibly implemented to ensure all students have an equal opportunity
to learn.

7. **If I need more information about what my child is missing, how can I get it?**
    The first step you can take is to check Infinite Campus. If you don’t have a login, you can
    contact the office at 628-3900 or use your child’s login information. If that doesn’t provide the
    additional information you need, please contact your child’s teacher via email or phone.
8. **Why does my child appear on the ICU list when he/she is absent from school? How**
    **many days are given to complete work due to absence?**
    The ICU list is a form of notification. If your child is absent, the notification part of the ICU list
    helps you stay informed about what your child missed. Students have two days for each day
    of excused absence to complete missed work without penalty.
9. **Is ICU a punishment?**
    ICU is **not intended to be a punishment** but insteada form of help for students. If students
    are struggling with learning, we want to ensure they have ample opportunity, in the form of
    extra time and extra support, to make certain they can achieve academic success. Because
    of this, students on the ICU list experience a reduction of school privileges to remind them of
    the importance of completing their extra practice. Most students who get on the ICU list are
    back off in the first 1-3 days. If your child is on the ICU list, it’s ok! Most of us have
    experienced missing a deadline or being late for an appointment; our kids might do the same
    from time to time. You can think of it as an opportunity to dialogue with your child about
    school.

## PROPERTY

### CELLULAR PHONES AND ELECTRONIC DEVICES

We recognize that there are applications of electronic devices that can embrace learning in the
classroom. However, unauthorized use of such devices disrupts the instructional program and
distracts from the learning environment. Therefore, unauthorized use is grounds for confiscation of
the device by school officials, including classroom teachers, custodians, and supervisory aides.

Students may use electronic devices on campus before school begins and after school ends.
Electronic devices, including headphones, that were not school issued will only be allowed in
the lockers from 8:05 am till 3:20 (This includes, but not limited to smartwatches, Ipads, cell
phones, etc). They should not be seen or heard and that includes being carried in clothing.

They will not be allowed at lunch or any other free time.

Videos and pictures on school grounds are a violation of personal privacy and are prohibited without
immediate staff authorization and supervision.

Classroom use: Personal technology can be used in the classroom at the discretion of the teacher.
Teachers also have the discretion to store or give specific directions with regard to personal
technology under their supervision.

Emergencies/Drills: Personal technology devices are a safety issue during an emergency. Therefore,
personal technology devices are not allowed during emergencies/drills and will be confiscated.

**At no time will any student operate a cell phone, iPod, or other electronic device with video
capabilities in a locker room, bathroom, or other location where such operation may violate**


**the privacy right of another person. Students will receive an initial out-of-school suspension
period up to ten (10) days.**

### CARE OF SCHOOL PROPERTY

Students will be responsible for the careful handling of books, athletic equipment, and other school
property. Fines will be assessed at the end of each school year for damage done to books/property.
Students are responsible for any school property that has been checked out under their name.
**Lockers and schedules will not be issued the following school year to students owing fines.
No student will be allowed to participate in 8th grade completion ceremonies until all fines
have been paid. Any unpaid fines will carry over to Laurel High School.**

### LOCKERS

Lockers will be assigned to all students at the beginning of the school year. Students using yellow
lockers will be assigned a school lock that must be used and returned upon checking out at the end
of the year. If a student is missing a lock, they will be charged for replacing the lost lock. **No
switching of lockers is permitted**. Lockers will bemaintained in a clean and neat manner at all
times. Students are advised not to share their combination with other students. Lockers are the
property of the school, and students are expected to maintain their lockers. Locks should not be
rigged in any way by jamming them with objects such as pencils. Failure to properly maintain the
locker may result in loss of the locker. The following policies shall apply to the search of school
property assigned to a specific student (locker, desk, etc.) and the seizure of items in his/her
possession. Coats are expected to be stored in lockers during the school day.

### STUDENT PRIVACY

The right to privacy is a fundamental tenet of human liberty. Staff shall take particular care to respect
students’ privacy. At the same time, they must protect the health and safety of all students and
promote the effective operation of the schools. The administration, the superintendent, or other such
staff designated by the superintendent shall have the authority to conduct student searches. They
shall do so only upon reasonable suspicion and the manner described by district policy.

For purposes of this policy and subsequent policies dealing with the specifics of student and school
property searches, the definition of reasonable suspicion is as follows:


“Reasonable suspicion” is the standard for a search on school property or at school
related events which is based on the school official’s specific reasonable inferences
which he or she is entitled to draw from the facts in light of the school official’s
experience. Specific reasonable inferences that may be drawn from include, but are
not limited to, a tip from a reliable student, suspicious behavior which suggests that
contraband is present, or a smell indicating the presence of the contraband.
Reasonable suspicion should not be based on mere hunch.

### SEARCHES OF STUDENTS AND THEIR PROPERTY

A student shall be free from searches of his/her clothing and other personal property unless there is
reasonable suspicion to believe that something is concealed that may be of immediate danger to the
student or other students. If that cause exists, an administrator shall request the studenttoremove
all items from pockets or other personal effects. If the student refuses and there is no immediate
danger, the administrator shall refrain from a search until the parent, guardian, or in the case of
possible criminal activity, law enforcement officers are contacted. Pat down searches or other such


intrusive searches of a student’s person will only be conducted by the parent, guardian, or
appropriate law enforcement officer.

Whenever deemed reasonable by the person conducting the search, the search will be conducted in
the presence of at least one adult witness and a written record of the time, date, and results shall be
made by the administrator; a copy shall be forwarded to the superintendent as soon as possible. In
any situation where the administrator is in doubt as to the propriety of proceeding with any search or
seizure, he/she is authorized to report to and comply with the directions of any public law
enforcement agency.

### LOCKER SEARCHES

School lockers and desks are and shall remain the property of the school district. The school
exercises exclusive control over school property, and students should not expect privacy regarding
items placed in school property because school property is subject to periodic check or search at
any time by designated school officials.

No student may use a locker as a depository for a substance or object which is prohibited or which
constitutes a threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the occupants of the school building or the
building itself. The board authorizes the principal, or other designated administrator, to inspect an
individual student’s locker when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the locker is improperly
used for the storage of contraband, a substance or object the possession of which is illegal, or any
materials which pose a hazard to the safety and good order of the school.

The superintendent may authorize the use of canines whose reliability and accuracy for sniffing out
contraband has been established to aid in the search for contraband in school owned property. The
canines must be accompanied by a qualified and authorized trainer who will be responsible for the
dog’s actions. In addition, a local law enforcement office will also be present during the search. An
indication by the dog that contraband is present on school property shall be deemed suspicion for a
further search by school officials. Canines shall not be used to search students.

### LOST AND FOUND ARTICLES

A lost and found department is located in the main hallway near the library. Students who find
articles of value are asked to turn them in to the school office. Students who have lost an article may
check periodically to see if it has been returned. An effort will be made to help locate the articles.
**Please mark all personal items with the student's first and last name** .Articles are also
periodically donated to Community Hope.

### TEXTBOOKS

Textbooks are carefully selected by your teachers and other professional educators from among the
finest available in the world today. They are paid for by your parents or guardians and other adults
through tax funds with the hope that you may receive some of the best help possible in becoming a
competent, successful citizen. These books deserve maximum use and reasonable care. After
books are issued and their condition noted, they are your responsibility until you check them in at the
end of the courses. A fine may be assessed for other than normal wear or for lack of proper care of
books. If you willfully damage a book or if you lose a book, you will be charged its replacement
value. Students are asked to keep book covers on all textbooks

### LIBRARY

The Laurel Middle School library is open from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. each school day (7:30 a.m.-
4:00 p.m. on Wednesday) and is available for staff and student use during the lunch hour.


Libraries are state certified with specialist degrees and trained to provide students and staff with
instruction on how to access material in both electronic and print formats. They deliver weekly
instruction based on Montana Library Standards. The library’s automated system provides users with
quick access to the collection. This aspect empowers student learners by providing them with
greater access to the library’s many resources. Annual book fairs offer students, staff, and the
community access to new literature in addition to providing the library with revenue.

### BICYCLES, SKATEBOARDS & SKATES

All bicycles must stay away from students on the grounds, traffic in the parking lot, and the bus
loading stations. Walk your bike on and off the grounds to the bike racks. Bikes, skates, and
skateboards are not allowed to be used on the grounds or in the buildings at any time. Skates and
skateboards are to be removed or picked up upon entering the school property. If a student
repeatedly disregards the rules for bicycles, skateboards, or skates, he/she may be required to leave
those items at home for the remainder of the year.

## HEALTH SERVICES

If a student has health-related problems he/she would like to discuss with the school nurse, she
welcomes the opportunity to be of service. The student may make an appointment directly with her
at her office or through the counselor. The nurse’s office is located next to the Middle
School office. The services of our school nurse are available to students on a limited basis. She is
assigned to work with students in multiple buildings, but is usually at the Middle School on Monday,
Tuesday, and Thursday. For these reasons, she may not always be expected to be available in the
building for emergency first aid attention.

### ILLNESS AT SCHOOL

If a student becomes ill at school, he/she should report to the nurse. If the nurse is not available,
students are to report to the school office. Students must not leave the building because of illness
without authorization. The school nurse informs teachers about students with health care needs and
how to make accommodations in the classroom, if necessary.

The school nurse will do screening, re-screening, and referrals for grades 5-8 for vision. Due to a
decrease in funding, the school nurse will no longer do scoliosis screening at LMS. It is suggested
that parents request a scoliosis check when their child is in for an appointment with their health care
provider. Hearing screening is conducted at your child’s school. Pure tone screening is mandated for
students in grades K, 1, and 10. Students in other grades will also be screened if they are new to the
school, on the annual hearing re-check list, or referred by the school or parent/guardian. If your child
is absent, unable to complete the pure tone screening, or does not pass the pure tone screening,
they will be referred for a hearing re-screen. The Hearing Conservation Program audiologist will
conduct the hearing re-screen and, in addition to the pure tone screening, may also conduct one or
both of the following: Otoacoustic Emissions (OAEs) Screening, which is a measure of cochlear
(inner ear) function that does not require the child to respond and/or Immittance Screening, which
measures the movement of the eardrum by putting positive and negative air pressure into the ear
canal.

### OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATION

Over the counter medications IN THEIR ORIGINAL CONTAINERS, INCLUDING LABELS, may be
kept by students in their locker or backpack. It is the responsibility of the parent/guardian to ensure
that their child understands the proper administration of over the counter medications prior to


sending the medication to school with their student. School staff will not supervise the administration
of over the counter medications. Students must not provide medication to any other student.

### PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION

Prescription medication to be taken at school must be carried in the original, labeled container. The
parent/guardian needs to submit a completed “Medication Consent Form”, including the prescribing
provider’s signature, for all prescription medications prior to school personnel supervising the
administration of the medication. It is the student’s responsibility to come to the office to take their
medication. Parents must come to the school to retrieve leftover prescription medication. It will not
be sent home with the student.

## ACTIVITIES & SPORTS

### SPORTS

Laurel Middle School competes in an interscholastic athletic program. All seventh and eighth grade
boys and girls meeting the eligibility requirements may participate. Fifth graders may participate in
wrestling and cross country. Sixth graders may participate in cross country, softball and wrestling.
There will be a no-cut program in athletics which will give all seventh and eighth grade students the
opportunity to participate. Basketball programs for fifth and sixth grade students will be scheduled by
Community Education. Any student who is at least fifteen (15) years old on or before midnight
August 31 may be declared eligible for participation in MHSA contests by the Montana High School
Board of Control. The student may be enrolled as a 7THor 8thgrader. The Montana high school for
which the student will participate must file the request to the Board of Control for consideration. If
you have questions regarding this rule, contact the district athletic director.

### EVENTS SPONSORED BY THE SCHOOL

Students at school sponsored events on or off the school campus shall be governed by school
district rules and regulations and are subject to the authority of school district officials. A student’s
attendance at such events is conditional upon his/her observance of school rules and regulations. All
student meetings in school buildings or on school grounds may function only as a part of the formal
educational process or as authorized by the principal.

### EXPECTATIONS FOR SPORTS EQUIPMENT

During each athletic season, students will be provided with the equipment and uniforms necessary to
participate in that sport. At the completion of each season, students will be expected to return the
equipment to the coach or be expected to pay for the value to replace the equipment. It is the
coach’s responsibility to inventory what has been issued to make sure all items are returned at the
end of the season. **The student will be prohibitedfrom participation in the next athletic
season(s) until the equipment has been returned or the fines have been paid in full**. The
parents will also be notified immediately by the coach, and the school office will be notified that
equipment is missing and a fine has been issued.

### ELIGIBILITY RULES

Students in grades 6TH,7TH, and 8THgrade are eligiblefor all extra-curricular involvement including
sports and clubs by meeting the following requirements:
A. Students in grades 6, 7, and 8 are eligible for activities/sports if they are in regular
attendance and are maintaining a 2.0 GPA with not more than one “F”. All graded classes
are checked at each midterm and each quarter. Students on academic probation who are
working on bringing their grades up will be allowed to practice. However, they will not be able



to play in games until the next grade checkpoint (midterm or quarter). Parents or guardians
may, at any time, keep their child from participating for whatever reasons they choose.
B. Students on the ICU list will be required to go to the ICU Rescue Room daily for one half
hour during lunch, or after school until they are off the ICU list. With a note signed by the ICU
Rescue Room staff, a student may be allowed into practice or a team meeting and is
considered excused.
C. All 6th, 7th, and 8th grade 4th quarter grades will carry over to determine eligibility for fall
activities.
D. If a child is on ICU the day of the activity he/she will not be able to participate.
E. All athletes must have a signed pledge form on file in the school office for each school year
or they will not be eligible to participate in practices or games. A student will only have to
sign one athletic pledge sheet for the school year.
F. Students who will be absent from school to participate in activities of any kind will be required
to complete all assignments missed by the next school day.
G. If Students get a major write up that results in ISS or OSS the student will not be able to
participate in current week’s games or events or the next game or event in the case there
isn’t one that week.
H. After the second major write up that results in ISS or OSS the student will be removed from
the team.

### MEDICAL RELEASE EXCUSES-PHYSICAL EDUCATION POLICY

If a student has a parent or guardian excuse exempting him/her from P.E. because of illness, etc.,
then he/she will receive an excuse from the school office for one (1) day only. Any excuse beyond
this time limit must come from a doctor. It is the parent’s or guardian’s responsibility to get this
checked, and the excuse delivered to the proper personnel at the school.

Any student in grades 6 through 8 who has a medical release from a doctor will not participate in any
physical education activity until the doctor supplies written permission for him/her to continue in the
P.E. activity. It is the parent’s or guardian’s responsibility to obtain this written permission. The
student will be required to satisfactorily complete written assignments or perform other
non-participation activities as required by the teacher to earn a passing grade.

## BEHAVIOR OR DISCIPLINE

### DRESS AND GENERAL APPEARANCE

The personal appearance and dress of the students is left to the good taste and discretion of the
individual student and his/her parents or guardians. Students are expected to be ladies and
gentlemen in school and should dress accordingly. Occasionally, students select clothing that is
distracting to the educational process. In these cases, the student must be asked to change. Below
are a list of general dress appearance guidelines.


●Clothing needs to cover the entire buttocks or torso. No tube tops, half shirts, halters for
example.
● Clothing can not expose the entire thigh, such as micro minis or short shorts.
● Clothing needs to be opaque and can not be see-through.
● No clothing or accessories which show profanity, obscene words or pictures, sexually
suggestive statements, or incites to violence (this includes shirts and bracelets that say
“Virginity Rocks!”, “I love Boobs” for Breast Cancer Awareness).
● No clothing representing gang-related activities



● No bathing suits or cut-offs
● The wearing and carrying of tobacco promotional items, or items promoting controlled
substances (drugs) and/or alcohol is prohibited.
● No clothing where undergarments are exposed (Thick bra strap slightly shows is ok,
spaghetti straps are not).
● No clothing that has text that is libelous, bullying, constitutes harassment or discrimination.
● Appropriate footwear, such as shoes and sandals must be worn at school and all functions.
No shoes with rollers or the wheels need to be taken off while at school.
● Head coverings including but not limited to hats, hoods, and bandanas are not to be worn in
the school building.
● No earbuds/earphones/listening devices.

**School administration reserves the right to determine appropriate dress**. Students in violation
of the dress code will be asked to contact parents/guardians for a change of clothing. If
parents/guardians are unable to provide a change of clothing, the student may be asked to change
into clothing provided by the office.

### PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF AFFECTION (P. D. A.’S)

Students are naturally going to seek ways to show their friendship and affection at this age. The
school expects that students will use good judgment and refrain from using “inappropriate” displays
of affection.
**The administration and staff will make the determination as to what is “appropriate” or not**.

### CHEATING AND PLAGIARIZING

All students are advised and counseled to avoid cheating on a test, copying another student’s
composition or homework, and plagiarizing the ideas, words, or writings of another. Students who
are determined to have cheated or plagiarized will be expected to redo the assignment on their own;
documentation will be made. A second offense of cheating will result in a disciplinary referral, and
appropriate consequence, and adequate completion of the assignment. Teachers are responsible for
notifying parent/guardian of both incidents.

### ANTI-BULLYING POLICY

Laurel Middle School will strive to provide a positive and productive learning and working
environment. Hazing, harassment, intimidation, menacing, cyber bullying by students, staff, or third
parties is strictly prohibited and shall not be tolerated. Students whose behavior is found to be in
violation of this policy will be subject to discipline up to and including expulsion. Staff whose behavior
is found to be in violation of this policy will be subject to appropriate sanctions as determined and
imposed by the superintendent or the board. Individuals may also be referred to law enforcement
officials.

Bullying behavior may include physical behavior but is also defined as excessive name calling,
shunning, repeatedly making unkind remarks, and other harassing behaviors. Students and/or
parents are encouraged to report bullying behaviors to the Principal or Assistant Principal
immediately. All reports will be investigated promptly. Consequences will apply according to the grid
in the discipline section of this handbook.

### TRANSPORTATION

Bus transportation is provided in accordance with the general policies and rules established by the
school district. Students must conduct themselves properly, or they may be denied the privilege of
transportation. This rule also applies to the activity bus while on school business to and from school


sponsored activities. A written list of student, driver, and parent responsibilities will be provided to
each bus student by the Transportation Office. Consequences will apply according to the grid in the
discipline section of this handbook.

**Student responsibilities in accordance with Appendix B of the Transportation Handbook:**

1. Students shall board the bus in an orderly manner.
2. There shall be no pushing or scuffling while the bus is loading.
3. Upon entering the bus, students shall go immediately to a seat and sit down.
4. Students shall keep arms, hands, head, and all parts of the body inside the bus at all times-
    never out the window.
5. Students shall not throw objects out of the bus while it is standing still or moving.
6. Students shall keep books, packages, equipment, or other objects out of the aisles at all
    times. Articles shall either be placed under the seat or held in the lap of the student.
7. Talk shall be in conversational tone at all times. There shall be no shouting at passersby.
8. Scuffling, playing, or fighting on the bus may distract the driver and cause an accident. This
    may endanger the lives of the riders.
9. Students shall remain in seats at bus stops until the bus is completely stopped.
10.When it is necessary for a pupil to cross the road at a bus stop, the crossing should be made
    only in front of the bus after looking both ways to make sure no traffic is approaching from
    either direction and upon signal from the driver. The student shall cross TEN FEET in front of
    the bus.
11.Students shall follow directions given by the driver and/or his assistant.
12.Older pupils shall help look after the safety and comfort of other children, especially the
    smaller children.
13.Profanity, vulgarity, or indecent language will not be tolerated.
14.STUDENTS WILL BE ALLOWED ON OR OFF THE BUS ONLY AT THEIR DESIGNATED
    STOP UNLESS WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM PARENT/GUARDIAN, AND SIGNED BY
    BUILDING PRINCIPAL HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY THE BUS DRIVER AND THE
    TRANSPORTATION OFFICE HAS BEEN INFORMED.
15.No smoking, drugs, tobacco, and/or intoxicating liquor are allowed on the bus.
16.Only authorized students will be allowed to ride the bus, unless there is an emergency. AN
    EMERGENCY CONSISTS OF: DEATH AND ILLNESS IN THE FAMILY OR ROAD
    CONDITIONS. A REQUEST FOR PERMISSION WILL BE SIGNED BY
    PARENT/GUARDIAN AND PRINCIPALS INVOLVED. In emergency situations, requests by
    non-certified riders to ride the bus must have parental permission and be approved by the
    principal. The school office will notify the Transportation Office and the bus driver should be
    notified, and school will give the driver a copy of the medical form.
17.Students may be assigned seats by the driver. If there is any vandalism occurring to the
    assigned seat, the student who has been assigned that seat will be liable for the vandalism.
    It is highly recommended that seats be assigned.
18.Students should board the bus at their school only.

### RECESS BEHAVIOR

Students are expected to follow the LOCO’s code at all times. The school’s priority with outside
play is to maintain a safe atmosphere for all students. Students are expected to adhere to the
following guidelines.


● Students must always be Respectful, Responsible, and Safe
● Students must remain within the supervised area.



● Students must be respectful and kind to others.
● Rough housing, tackling, shoving, throwing snowballs, etc will not be permitted.
● In order to keep a clean and safe playground students will not be permitted to have any
food or drinks outside. If a student has food or drinks they will be asked to dispose of it
immediately.
● Areas such as ponds, ditches and bike racks are off limits.
● Phones or other electronic devices are not permitted.
● Students must be respectful of school equipment, property and playground equipment.
● Recess will be held inside when the temperature drops below zero including windchill.

This list is not all inclusive. Students must obey all safety rules as deemed appropriate by
school personnel.

Students caught in violation will first be given a verbal warning to stop. The grid below is after
verbal warning has been given.

### DISCIPLINE STEP PROGRAM

State law gives the school a responsibility for student behavior, not only in the school building, but at
any school activity, in school buses and on the way to and from school. So remember, if the student
breaks any rules at a school activity or gets into a fight on the way home, he/she is still subject to
school rules and regulations.

In order for a student to learn and a teacher to instruct, there must be an atmosphere in the school
that is conducive to learning. Behavior that interrupts or disturbs this orderly environment cannot be
tolerated and must be dealt with promptly, firmly, fairly, and consistently.

Teachers will assign consequences within their classroom for inappropriate behavior. See Level One
of the consequence grid for classroom level consequences. Students who are required to stay after
school may have one day to make transportation with no penalty. When a student’s behavior
requires administrative attention, a disciplinary referral will be made to the school office. The teacher
may request a specific alternative discipline other than a step.

It is the intent of the Laurel Middle School administration to support the teachers in the areas of
classroom behavior and student discipline. In order to make this effort successful, we feel that it is
essential for the students, teachers, and parents or guardians to become familiar with the STEP
program for discipline.

The STEP system approach to school discipline is based on the belief that students must be
responsible for all of their actions while in attendance at school. When students are referred to the
administration for a violation of school rules, the administrator bases the resulting consequences on
how many times the student has been sent to the office during the current school year. A student
that consistently disrupts the learning environment needs to receive more severe consequences
than the first-time offender. The consequences are ascending in nature of severity. This ladder of
ascending consequences applies to all violations of school rules, with the exception of severe
inappropriate behaviors. These severe behaviors include alcohol and other drugs, assault, the use of
obscene language toward any faculty or staff member, etc. Exceptions automatically result in
immediate severe consequences such as suspension or a recommendation to expel. The
administrator may recommend expulsion before a student reaches the expulsion hearing step when:
A. The student has received multiple disciplinary reports in different behavioral categories, and


B. The administration determines the student is creating a serious disruption to the learning
environment and structure of the school.
The STEP program provides students with the opportunity to redeem themselves and move
backward on the ascending ladder of consequences. If a student is not referred to the school office
for disciplinary reason for forty-five (45) school days, he/she will move one (1) STEP backward on
the ladder. This allows each student to “wipe” their disciplinary slate “clean” should they so choose.
The administration may enter into an individualized behavioral contract with a student and his/her
parents or guardians if necessary.
On the following pages of this handbook, the student rights, the disciplinary STEPs, and the
exceptions are spelled out. It is extremely important that students, teachers, and parents or
guardians become familiar with each of these areas.

### DETENTION AREA

A detention area has been set aside for all in-school suspensions. A student may be placed in the
detention room for any reason deemed necessary by the administration. The detention room will be
used to isolate individuals whose behavior is not conducive to the learning environment. A student
referred to the school office by any faculty or staff member may not be sent back to class that
particular period. Instead, the administrator will place him/her in the detention room for the remainder
of that period and assign the student to the appropriate disciplinary STEP. The detention room will be
monitored by a staff member and will be a silent study hall. The teacher will send work to the
detention room.

### RULES OF THE DETENTION AREA

1. Students will be expected to work quietly and independently.
2. Students will be expected to work on school work.
3. Students will be allowed to go to the library.
4. Food and drink will not be permitted.
5. Music and other electronic devices will not be permitted.
6. Disruptive behavior, sleeping, and note writing will not be permitted.


NO WARNINGS will be given. Failure to comply withthese rules will result in the student
being placed at the next appropriate STEP as assigned by the administrator.

### DISCIPLINE FORMS

**- DETENTION TIME**
    Detention time is to be used as a study hall. It is not to be used for eating, sleeping, or as
    a social time for visiting. It is to be used for study. If students do not come prepared to
    study, assignments will be provided for them. Any student who has violated the detention
    rules will receive no credit for the detention time served. Detention time will be served
    after school. No student will be excused from detention to participate in any school
    practice or activity, to go to work, or ride the bus. If the student fails to arrive for detention
    time, the time will be doubled. **“Teachers may alsohave their own policies and can**
    **assign detention to be served in their classrooms.”**


**- SATURDAY SCHOOL**


The Saturday Detention program is designed as an alternative to short-term suspension
and as a positive approach to dealing with students who do not comply with school
policies. No instruction is involved but school work is encouraged. Saturday School will
be served at Laurel Middle School from 8:00am through 12:00 noon on most Saturdays
during the school year. Parents will be notified prior to student placement in Saturday
School. Like detentions, Saturday School will take precedence over school activities and
student jobs. Failure to attend Saturday School will result in one (1) day Out of School
Suspension the following Tuesday or one day after a conference with the assistant
principal or principal. Students are expected to be on time and to remain for the duration
of the assigned detention. Supervisors will assign each student a seat and full
cooperation is expected for the entire detention period. If a student fails to meet these
obligations, Saturday Detention will be reassigned, doubled, or suspension may occur.

**- SUSPENSION**


Suspensions are assigned according to the STEP Discipline/Consequence Grid. A
suspension may be an in-school or an out-of-school placement. Students are not allowed
on school grounds at any time during an out-of-school suspension. Students are not
allowed to participate in any school activities on the day of any suspension with the
exception of performing in choir and band concerts as these performances are a required
part of the curriculum. Students are provided with missed class work during all
suspensions and are required to make up that work for credit. In special cases the
principal may request an extension of suspension from the Superintendent of Schools or
his/her designee.

**- EMERGENCY SUSPENSION**


A student may be immediately removed from school without prior use of the due process
procedures if the student’s presence in school poses a continuing danger to person or
property, or an ongoing threat or disruption of the academic process.

**- LONG TERM SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION FROM SCHOOL**


A student may be expelled only by the Board of Trustees. If the violation of school
regulations is of a serious enough nature, the student will be sent home after the
parents/guardians, or persons in charge have been notified of the intent to expel. The
parents/guardians, or persons in charge and the student may request a hearing with the
principal and Superintendent of Schools, or his/her designee. If the student is not
reinstated after the hearing with the principal and the Superintendent of Schools, or
his/her designee, the principal will request in writing to the Board of Trustees, through the
Superintendent of Schools, that the student be expelled. A copy of the letter requesting
expulsion of the student will be sent to the parents/guardians, or persons in charge may
request a hearing at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Trustees. The
Board, after the hearing with the student and parents/guardians, or persons in charge,
will act upon the request of the principal to expel. If a hearing is not requested and a



letter requesting a student expulsion is presented to the Board, the Board will act upon
the request.

ADDITIONAL DISTRICT POLICY INTERPRETATIONS AND DEFINITIONS

1. Reporting an incident to Local Law Enforcement: If in the determination of the investigating
    administrator, an offense is serious enough and is a violation of state or local laws, he/she
    will contact local authorities. In such cases, the school reserves the right to conduct its own
    investigation and take such appropriate action that may be indicated under the discipline
    code.
2. Video/Audio Surveillance: The Board authorizes the use of video cameras on district
    property or on district buses to ensure the health, welfare, and safety of all staff, students,
    and visitors to district property, and to safeguard district facilities and equipment. Video
    cameras may be used in locations as deemed appropriate by the superintendent. Students
    or staff in violation of board policies, administrative regulations, building rules, or law shall be
    subject to appropriate disciplinary action. Others may be referred to law enforcement
    agencies.

STUDENT RIGHTS
Before discipline is invoked, the student shall be given an opportunity to present his/her version of
the situation. If, however, a student’s presence in the school is dangerous or disruptive, the student
can be sent home immediately. Procedures for immediate suspension are as follows:

1. The principal will notify the parents or guardians that the student is being suspended.
2. The principal will arrange a conference with the student and the parents or guardians at a
    time to be determined by the principal to discuss the terms of the suspensions and
    conditions for reinstatement.


3. The principal should recommend to the Superintendent to reinstate the student or to
    recommend to the Board of Trustees that he/she be expelled from school.

If any student or his/her parent/guardian is aggrieved by any disciplinary action, then he/she will
have the right to make a formal protest, either in writing or in person to the Board of Trustees at their
next regular meeting. Such protest shall be heard in an open meeting unless a closed session is
specified by the student and/or parent/guardian. The Board of Trustees shall notify the student
and/or parent/guardian in writing of the decision within ten (10) days.

APPEAL PROCESS
Parents or guardians may appeal a disciplinary action by contacting the assistant principal or
principal requesting an appeal. The assigned discipline will be suspended pending the outcome of
the appeal. A disciplinary appeal will involve a reassessment of the circumstances of the incident
and a determination of whether the discipline assigned was appropriate or not. The progression of
appeal begins with either the assistant principal or the principal and then if necessary proceeds to
the district superintendent and then the school board.
