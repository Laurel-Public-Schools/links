### Students Absent From School

There is a policy in the student handbook regarding students absent from school who are
involved in extra-curricular activities. This policy states the following: Students absent during
the day and/or part of the day on an activity or practice will not be permitted to participate in that
event. For example, suppose the student is absent the Friday before an event on the next day
(Saturday). In that case, they may be permitted to participate in the activity on that Saturday with
the consent of the parent, the Administration, and the head coach or group advisor of the event.
On overnight trips, when the team leaves before a Saturday, students absent the day before may
not be allowed to accompany the team. Approval for participation will be considered if the
absence in question results from a previously scheduled medical/dental/vision appointment. For
example, an appointment that satisfies requirements of the law, Senior Pictures being taken, or if
the absence results from some family emergency, or with the approval of the head coach,
building principal, and the activities director. A student will not be excused from assigned
detention time for practice or school activity.

### Students Arriving Home Late

must go through the activities director or principal.

3. LPSeventshavepriorityovernon-LPSeventsunlesspriorarrangementshavebeenmade

### Responsibility for Equipment Return

The student must agree to be responsible for the safe return or replacement of all athletic and/or
activity equipment issued by the school. A fee will be accessed if the equipment is lost or needs
to be replaced.

### Notification of Parent/Guardians

Parents/guardians need to be notified by the coach when a given discipline action or other
failures on the athlete’s part will have a substantial or unexpected impact on the athlete’s playing
time.

### Participation Deadline

Students may apply to play a sport that misses the start of the season within **twelve** practice days.
Each Head Coach will have the final decision if approached by a student-athlete. Transfers
eligible for participation may start a sport at any reasonable time if the Head Coach and Admin
Team agree.

### 8th Grade Participation

8th graders will be allowed to participate in high school athletics in order to fill out a team roster.
The sports programs approved for 8th grade participation would be Boys Soccer, Wrestling, and
Softball for the 2022-2023 school year. 8th grade athletes will be required to attend a meeting
with the Head Coach, Guardians, and the Activities Director prior to the start of the regular
season. If a program does have low numbers, a recommendation and School Board approval
would be needed in order to allow 8th participation in a program not already approved.

## Chemical Use Policy

The opportunity to participate in the extra-curricular program sponsored by Laurel Public Schools is a privilege extended to all district students. Students who choose to be part of the program are expected to make the commitment to adhere to the philosophy and rules governing the various activities making up the district’s extra-curricular program. The board believes that participation in these types of activities can contribute to the all-around development of our students.
### Use or Possession of Illegal Drugs, Alcohol, or Tobacco: Policy 2155

#### The board further believes that necessary and proper rules governing the use of illegal substances serve the following purposes:

To emphasize concern for the health and well-being of students while participating in activities.

To provide an environment for the participants that is drug, alcohol, and tobacco-free.

To promote a sense of self-discipline among the students.

To confirm and support existing state laws governing minors and their use and abuse of illegal substances.

To emphasize standards of conduct for those students who through their participation are leaders and role models for their peers and younger students.

To assist students who desire to resist peer pressure to possess and use these substances.

*Tobacco-Free Policy (Student Handbook)
All school district property is hereby declared tobacco-free for all students. Use of possession of tobacco products by minors is both against the law and district policy. No use or possession of tobacco will be permitted on Laurel
School District grounds and facilities. Limitations or prohibitions on tobacco use are applicable during all hours. Additionally, the high school includes in this category all e-cigarettes and supplies ,vape 32 supplies, and accessories.*

### Coverage
These rules cover the use, personal possession, sale, or distribution of alcohol, illegal drugs, tobacco, and the abuse of prescription or nonprescription drugs. The policy is not intended to apply to the use of prescribed medications under a doctor’s supervision when those drugs are used in the prescribed manner.

A participant is in violation of this policy if he or she is knowingly in attendance at a gathering or function where illegal substances (except tobacco products) are present unless it is a family or recognized community gathering or function. Even if the participant is not in possession of, or using an illegal substance at the gathering or function, he or she will be subject to the consequences as outlined in this policy.
    
**1st Violation** – The student will be suspended from the activity they are currently participating in or the next activity they participate in for two weeks of competition. The offender may practice, but cannot participate in a formal activity or performance. As part of this ban on participation, the student will not be allowed to be part of the team or group during an activity either home or away. The student will be required to meet with a Chemical Dependency Counselor for an evaluation and provide written documentation verifying the appointment.
    
**2nd Violation** – The student will be suspended or excluded from ALL extra-curricular activities for the remainder of the school year. The student will also be required to meet with a Chemical Dependency Counselor for additional evaluation services and provide written documentation verifying this appointment. This verification must be provided to the school district before the student is allowed to participate in any activities the following year.

If any violation of this policy occurs during the last two weeks of the spring season, the student will not be allowed to participate during the first two weeks of competition in the next activity they participate in during the next school year. The student must also complete the entire season of the next activity they participate in order for this rule to apply.

**Non-season	Activities**	–	(Music,	clubs,	royalty	candidates,	class	officers,	and	any
school-sponsored trips.)

**1st Violation** – The student is excluded from all non-season school activities for 20 school days. The student will be required to meet with a Chemical Dependency Counselor for an evaluation and provide written documentation verifying the appointment.

**2nd Violation** – The student will be suspended or excluded from ALL extra-curricular activities for the remainder of the school year. The student will also be required to meet with a Chemical Dependency Counselor for additional evaluation services and provide written documentation verifying the appointment. This verification must be provided to the school district before the student is allowed to participate in any activities the following year.
### Violations
The district may become aware of infractions through law enforcement or court officers. Otherwise, the student infractions must be reported and/or validated by employees of Laurel School District or members of the Board of Trustees if action is to be taken under this policy. The district reserves the right to conduct its own investigation; make a determination of guilt; and apply sanctions independent of any pending court action against the student arising from the same offense.
Policy Duration
The policy duration for this policy is for one academic year (1 school year), including the fall seasons that start before the academic school year.


## Code of Conduct

### LOCOMOTIVE CODE OF CONDUCT

```
I will be the best I can be and achieve at my highest level.
I will influence and encourage my peers in all their endeavors and projects
I will have the courage to take the “right” stand regardless of peer
pressure.
I will conduct myself in a manner that contributes to an orderly atmosphere and ensures the
rights of all individuals within the school.
I will be considerate and respectful of others.
I will give my best to my academic and extra-curricular pursuits.


I will demonstrate care and concern for school property and the property of others.
I will respond appropriately to the direction of faculty and staff at school and school activities.
I will be responsible for my attitude and behavior.
```
Failure of a student-athlete to adhere to the said above code of conduct may result in a
suspension from the program. Additionally, the Head Coach and AD/Admin will work together
using the Laurel High School Student Handbook and Laurel Public Schools Student
Transportation Handbook to determine the outcome of said violation.

### Expectations of Parents/Guardians

Athletic events are learning experiences for student-athletes. A ticket to a contest is a privilege to
observe athletic tests of skills, not to verbally assault others or be obnoxious. Audiences may
forget that high school athletes have not reached mature physical performance, so errors can be
expected. Moreover, audiences who learn the rules of the sport are less likely to criticize
officials, players, or coaches.

## Student-Athlete Advisory Council

To give student-athletes more of a voice, the Activities Department has created a SAAC. A
Junior or Senior will represent each program. Head Coaches and high school staff will submit
their recommendations at the end of the year for the following school year. Each member will
serve their term until graduation if selected as a Junior. In addition, a Laurel High School Student
Council representative will attend meetings and coordinate with the student body. The committee
will meet monthly with the AD to discuss the following topics and ideas.

```
● Promoting communication between student-athletes and the athletics administration
● Giving student-athletesa voicewithintheathleticsdepartmentwhennewpoliciesare
being considered
● Providing insight and feedback into issues affecting the athletics department
● Providing the student perspective on broader rules and regulations, such as those
proposed by state or national organizations

● Organizing and participating in community service efforts
● Boosting theimageofstudent-athletesoncampusandcreatingapositivevibeforthe
