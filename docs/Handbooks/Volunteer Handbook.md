## Superintendent Welcome Letter Contents

Dear Volunteer

Welcome to Laurel School District No. 7-70. We value the time and commitment
you make to the students and staff in our district. Each of you has special gifts to
share with us that enhance and enrich our schools and we appreciate your
willingness to donate your time to help a classroom, school or department.

Because student safety is of great concern, community volunteers are required
to:


● Complete a volunteer application
● Be fingerprinted
● Must possess a valid driver’s license or state issued ID

We hope you enjoy the time you spend with us. Being a volunteer brings
rewards as well as challenges. With your help, our schools can maximize their
potential and better meet the needs of students and staff. If you have
suggestions on how we can better use and support our volunteers, please let us
know.

Thank you for your time and commitment to our students, staff and our district!

Sincerely,

Dr. Linda Filpula

Superintendent



## Why We Value Our Volunteers

Laurel School District No. 7-70 serves over 2,000 students in Pre-K-12 in five
different schools utilizing a grade leveled configuration. South Elementary
houses all kindergarten and Pre-K students. West Elementary has 1st and 2nd
grade students before they move onto Graff Elementary for 3rd and 4th grade.
Laurel Middle School contains students in 5th through 8th grade and Laurel High
School educates our 9th through 12th grade students.

Schools alone cannot meet all the needs of our students in today’s environment.
Due to budget constraints and the changing complexion of the family, we face
economic, social, and education issues as never before. By working together
with our community, we can enhance the education of our students, which is
necessary for success in today’s world.

Laurel School District is fully committed to its mission statement: “Dedicated to
the individual development of each student, every day, without exception!” We
believe in providing different opportunities and experiences to educate our
students to reach their full potential. We not only provide a high-quality
education within the classroom, but offer students many curricular and
extracurricular activities to ensure students receive a well-rounded education.
The Laurel Community takes great pride in its schools and the education
provided to all of its students.

If you become involved within a school you will notice some immediate
changes from the classroom with which you may be familiar. Teachers and staff
now dress for function and movement within the classroom. Classrooms may be
quite noisy at times, and several activities may be happening within the same
room at the same time. Though this may at first appear as chaos, it is often the
sign of student engagement and learning.

As volunteers become familiar with the school and educational process of
today, they become important links with the community in order to help
establish the best educational system possible. It is our hope that you will
become such a link! We welcome and encourage your involvement in our
schools to provide the BEST education for your children. Together we can make
a difference in the lives of our kids!


## Getting Started

### Community
Community volunteers are required to:


1. Complete the Community Volunteer application at the desired grade
level, located online in the District Website. Once completed you will
return the application to the principal of the desired school, who will
then forward your information onto the Administration office.
2. Have a valid driver’s license or state issued ID
3. Be fingerprinted.

When your fingerprint clearance is received, we will notify you and the school
site you requested on your volunteer application of your volunteer status.

### Parents

Parents or guardians who wish to volunteer in their child’s classroom only (during
the school day. are not required to be fingerprinted. However, if a
parent/guardian would like to volunteer outside of their child’s classroom, in
before and after-school programs, or will accompany students on a field trip,
fingerprint clearance is required.


Parent volunteers are required to:
1. Complete the Parent Volunteer application and turn it into the school
office.
2. Have a valid driver’s license
3. Be fingerprinted, if needed.

### Applications

There are several ways to obtain an application:


⮚ Volunteer applications are located at the end of this handbook
⮚ Download from our website at http://www.laurel.k12.mt.us under the Human
Resource menu
⮚ Contact the school office

### Fingerprinting



We appreciate your time and your understanding as we take measures to
ensure the safety of our students. Fingerprint information is required as part of
our steps for processing community volunteer applications and for
parents/guardians who choose to volunteer beyond their child’s classroom. This
District will pay for the fingerprinting costs.

### Questions

If you have any questions regarding the application process and fingerprinting,
you may contact the district office at (406. 628-3360.

“Nothing you do for children is ever wasted. They seem not to notice us,
hovering, averting our eyes, and they seldom offer thanks, but what we do for
them is never wasted.”
Garrison Keillor

## Confidentiality

Confidentiality is a Legal Requirement


Federal law prohibits school districts from releasing non-directory student
information without parent/guardian permission. Disclosing this
information is a violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
of 1974 (FERPA..


All information concerning students and teachers is strictly confidential
and should not be shared with others. Keep ALL student information
confidential, including scholastic and health records, test scores and
grades, discipline and classroom behavior, and children’s character traits.



## Guidelines

### Supervision

Volunteers working in the schools should always be under the direct supervision
of school or district professional staff.

### Discipline

Volunteers may not discipline students. If a discipline problem arises, volunteers
should refer the situation to the professional staff. Our schools have specific
discipline procedures, and the responsibility of enforcement rests with the staff.

### Reporting Child Abuse, Non-accidental Injury, Neglect

In the course of volunteering, you may observe or hear a child describe child
abuse, non-accidental physical injury, neglect or other conditions which place
a child at risk. Montana has very detailed legal requirements for the reporting of
these concerns to either police or Child Protective Services (“C.P.S.”.. School
volunteers are bound by the same reporting requirements as teachers and other
school personnel. If you see or hear of these concerns, immediately report what
you have learned to your supervisor or the Principal of the school where you
volunteer. If you form a reasonable belief that child abuse, non-accidental
injury or neglect has occurred, the law requires you to personally report or
cause a report to be made to police or C.P.S.

### Dismissals

Volunteers are not allowed to dismiss a student from school. If a student must
leave school early, they must receive permission from the school office and sign
out early. Under no circumstance can volunteers take a student off campus, this
includes walking or driving a student home.

### Contacting Students

During your work as a school volunteer, you will meet many wonderful students.
Your work with them will be delightful and rewarding. Volunteers should not
contact students or visit them off campus or at their homes. In addition, students
should not be invited to the volunteer’s home.

### Confidentiality

While working within the schools, information about the progress, abilities and
concerns of students may be shared with you. This is information of a
confidential nature. Like teachers, volunteers are bound by a code of ethics to


keep confidential matters within the school. Do not discuss this information with
anyone who does not have a professional right or need to know.

Please do not discuss a student’s progress or difficulties with his or her
parents/guardians. This is the teacher’s responsibility. If a student confides in
you information of a personal nature, you will need to share this privately with
the teacher or principal if you feel it warrants their attention.

### Medical Treatment

Medical treatment for any student is the responsibility of the school nurse or
other authorized personnel. Volunteers may not administer medication to a
student. If a student becomes ill, follow school procedures in regards to
notifying the teacher and taking the student to the nurse.

### Personal Doctrines

The school respects and values each family’s beliefs and religious doctrines.
Volunteers may not propose any personal or religious beliefs to a student.

### Restrooms

Volunteers should utilize the staff restrooms. Volunteers should not use or
accompany students to the student restroom.

### Dress and Behavior

Volunteers should follow the lead of the professional staff and their supervisor.
Casual dress is the most appropriate. We ask that your attire be neat and
conservative, attracting no undue attention. Keep in mind that you are in a
position to set an example for students. Your dress, speech and behavior should
serve as a good model for students to follow.

### Dependability

Volunteers should always be prompt and consistent. If you cannot make your
scheduled volunteer time, the staff would appreciate as much notice as
possible. If you have a vacation pending, please provide advance notice to the
school. The work volunteers do is important, staff and students look forward to
your on-time arrival and volunteer assistance.

### Sign-in Procedures

Identify the appropriate sign-in procedure at your volunteer site. It is important
to sign in for insurance purposes. The time you donate is also recorded in order
to recognize the value of volunteers and their commitment.

### Speak up!

If you have any questions or concerns about your volunteer work or the policies
of the school or district, feel free to ask your direct supervisor or the volunteer
coordinator. We want this to be a rewarding experience for you, as well as for
our staff and students. We will be happy to answer any questions you may have
regarding your volunteer experience.

## Helpful tips

When you arrive at your volunteer site, you will want to ask certain questions and
feel comfortable with your new surroundings. As you meet with your supervisor
or teacher, be sure you determine one another’s expectations. You are not
expected to know exactly how to go about our volunteer position, and you
should feel comfortable asking questions as you go along.

## Don’t forget to ask...

As you tour the building, you may want to inquire about such things as:


● Where to park
● How to check in and keep track of your time
● Entrances and exits to the building
● Bathroom facilities available for your use
● Volunteers’ and/or teachers’ lounge and its use
● Telephone you may use if necessary
● Location of supplies you may need
● School phone numbers and names, you may need
● Classroom rules and teacher’s classroom management plan
You are an important member of the team, and we want you to feel at
home in your new “volunteer” environment.

## Tips for School Volunteers

###  Call students by name at each opportunity


A student’s name is very important. Make every effort to pronounce and
spell each student’s name correctly.

### Be firm with students, but also be warm and friendly


Let each student know that you care about him/her.

### Accept students as they are


Each student is unique. Be ready to accept these differences in
background, values, and aspirations.


### Encourage and praise students


Use positive comments that will make students feel good about
themselves, even when they are having difficulty. Be ready to praise a
student for even the smallest successes. Avoid saying anything that will
make students doubt themselves or their ability to learn. Children begin to
“be” what others think of them.

### Remember that children never forget


If you promise something, be prepared to keep the promise. Be careful
not to make promises you will be unable to keep.

### Encourage students to do their own thinking


Try not to give students the answers before they have an opportunity to
solve questions on their own. Silence often means a student is thinking.
Give them plenty of time to answer.

## Follow the teacher’s lead for classroom behavior


Don’t allow students to behave in ways the teacher does not allow.
Remember, the teacher is available to handle discipline problems. Make
certain the students with whom you are working do not disturb the rest of
the class.

### Reinforce good behavior


When students are behaving well, let them know how proud you are and
how much you appreciate their effort. This will encourage them to try
even harder. If possible, try to ignore minor behavior problems if no
student is at risk of any harm, and teaching and learning are not
interrupted. Express displeasure with the behavior, not the student.

### Remember it’s okay if you don’t know the answers


Let the student know when you don’t know the answer or you are not
certain what to do. Work the answers out with students, or ask the teacher
for assistance at an appropriate time.

### Supervise students carefully


Do not leave a student or small group of students unsupervised. Be aware
of what the students are doing at all times.

### Keep students on task


You will want the students to learn as much as possible during the short
time they spend with you; keep the lesson or activity moving. Avoid
allowing students to get you, or the group off track for long periods of time
by discussing topics that have nothing to do with the lesson.

### Know when to give proper motivation


Your positive works of encouragement will go far in helping students
become excited about learning. You and the teacher can discuss the use
of motivation materials such as stickers, stars or notes of praise. Please do
not give students food. Volunteers may not give students advertisements
or solicitations.

### Don’t get discouraged


Don’t get discouraged if you feel that little academic progress is being
made. Your very presence and interest is helping the student to be
successful.

#### We thank you for your valuable contribution to our youth!

## Medical and Worker’s Compensation Insurance Coverage

The district does not carry medical insurance for volunteers; however, volunteers
must be registered at the school they are serving and a record of volunteer
hours must be maintained for workers’ compensation coverage. That is why it is
important for you to sign in and out each time you volunteer. If you have
questions about this liability coverage, feel free to call the Human Resources
Department.

Laurel Schools Board of Education entitles you to workers’ compensation
benefits per if you incur personal injury by an accident arising out of and in the
course of your volunteer employment with the district.
