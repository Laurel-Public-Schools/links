## Absences

### Discretionary Leave
Certified instructional employees shall be granted Discretionary Leave according to the terms of the current
collective bargaining agreement.

### Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
#### Eligibility
Employees are eligible if they have worked for the District for at least one (1) year, and for one thousand two
hundred fifty (1250) hours over the previous twelve (12) months.

#### Length / Purpose of Leave
To be eligible for FMLA leave, an individual must meet the following criteria:

a. Have worked at least 12 months (which do not have to be consecutive) for the employer; and

b. Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately before the date FMLA
leave begins.

The FMLA entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take job-protected, unpaid leave for
specified family and medical reasons. Eligible employees are entitled to twelve (12) workweeks of
leave in any twelve (12) month period for:

a. Birth and care of the employee's child, within one year of birth

b. Placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care, within one year of the
placement

c. Care of an immediate family member (spouse, child, parent) who has a serious health condition

d. For the employee's own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform
the essential functions of his or her job

e. Any qualifying event arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent
is on active duty or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty in the U.S.
National Guard or Reserves in support of a contingency operation

f. Twenty-six (26) workweeks of leave during a single twelve (12) month period to care for a
covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness if the employee is the spouse, son,
daughter, parent, or next of kin of the servicemember (Military Caregiver Leave)

If an employee was receiving group health benefits when leave began, an employer must maintain
them at the same level and in the same manner during periods of FMLA leave as if the employee
had continued to work. Accrued paid leave runs concurrently with the FMLA leave period. An
employee’s ability to substitute accrued paid leave is determined by the terms and conditions of
the employer’s normal leave policy.


Employees may take FMLA leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule (that is, in blocks
of time less than the full amount of the entitlement) when medically necessary or when the leave is
due to a qualifying event. Taking intermittent leave for the placement for adoption or foster care of
a child is subject to the employer's approval. Intermittent leave taken for the birth of a child is also
subject to the employer's approval. However, employer approval is not required for intermittent or
reduced schedule leave that is medically necessary due to pregnancy, a serious health condition,
or the serious illness or injury of a covered servicemember. Employer approval also is not required
when intermittent or reduced schedule leave is necessary due to a qualifying event.


When the need for leave is foreseeable, an employee must give the employer at least thirty (30)
days notice, or as much notice as is practicable. When the leave is not foreseeable, the employee
must provide notice as soon as practicable in the particular circumstances. An employee must
comply with the employer’s usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for
requesting leave, absent unusual circumstances. In requesting leave, an employee must provide
sufficient information for the employer to reasonably determine whether the FMLA may apply to the
leave request. When the employee seeks leave for a qualifying reason for which the employer has
previously provided the employee FMLA-protected leave, the employee must specifically reference
the qualifying reason for the leave or the need for FMLA leave.


### Service Member Family Leave
Subject to Section 103 of the FMLA of 1993, as amended, an eligible employee who is the spouse, son,
daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered service member shall be entitled to a total of twenty-six (26)
workweeks of leave during a twelve (12) month period to care for the service member. The leave described in
this paragraph shall only be available during a single twelve (12) month period and in accordance with Board
Policy 5328.

### Vacation
The classified and 12 month administrative employees shall accrue annual vacation leave benefits in
accordance with ŞŞ2-18-611, 2-18-612, 2-18-614 through 2018-617 and 2-18-621, MCA. Certified employees
shall refer to their master agreement regarding leave and discretionary days.

## Acceptable Use Policy

All staff/teachers are assigned to specific supervision duties during assemblies and are expected to be in their
assigned areas. Students may be removed from an assembly as deemed necessary by the staff member.
Generally, all students should be dealt with directly and/or referred to the office in accordance with established
building discipline procedures.

## Breaks

Scheduled breaks are provided to all classified employees to ensure safety and efficiency. All classified staff
members who are scheduled to work at least four (4) consecutive hours are entitled to one 15-minute break.
An additional 15 minute break will be provided during the second half of each work day for those employees
who are scheduled to work six (6) continuous hours or more as per negotiated agreement.


Classified employees are expected to adhere to the break schedule established by the building principal or
supervisor. Deviation from the regularly scheduled break period requires prior supervisor approval.

## Care / Use of District Property

All staff members are encouraged to exercise continuous and vigilant care of all district-owned property.
Incidents of theft or willful destruction of district property through vandalism or malicious mischief should be
reported immediately to the building principal. In the event of loss or damage, a fee will be assessed by the
district according to the repair or replacement costs.

## Cash in District Buildings

Money collected by staff as a result of fundraisers or other school-related purposes is to be deposited in the
office daily, regardless of the total dollar amount. Receipts are to be given for all cash/check items
immediately. One copy of the receipt must remain with the district. Bank deposits should be made on a weekly
basis.

## Checkout

Work Day Checkout
Teachers may leave the building and district grounds during the 45 minute duty free lunch. Teachers are
expected to be on duty for hall supervision before and after their 45 minute duty free lunch. Departures during
preparation periods must be approved by the building principal or assistant principal prior to leaving.

Classified staff is permitted to leave the building and district grounds during their lunch break, but not during
other breaks during the day without prior approval by supervisor.

Aside from lunch time, all staff is required to check out/in with the office prior to leaving. This will enable office
staff to respond appropriately in the event of message and emergency situations that may arise.

Year-End Checkout
The building principal will provide a final checkout form to be completed prior to leaving for summer. All
buildings will do a key inventory before all staff leave for summer break. This inventory is to be kept at each
building and shared with the Facilities Director. Inventory of textbooks and other items will also need to be
completed before final checkout. Building principals will have additional checkout procedures depending on
building needs.

## Child Abuse Reporting

All school personnel are considered mandatory reporters. Any staff member who has reasonable cause or
reasonable suspicion to believe that any child under 18 years of age with whom he/she has come in contact
has suffered abuse or neglect, or that any adult with whom he/she is in contact has abused a child, shall
immediately orally report to the Department of Family Services or local law enforcement agency. The building
principal and/or counselors are to be immediately informed. Child Abuse Hotline number can be found in the
appendix of this document (Child Abuse Reporting).

Written documentation of this report must be completed and submitted to the building principal. Forms can be
found in the appendix of this document (Calling DPHHS – FORM).

A staff member who, based on reasonable grounds, participates in the good-faith making of a child abuse
report shall have immunity from any liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred or imposed as
provided by law.


## Class Interruptions
The district is committed to protecting instructional time. Class interruptions of any kind will be kept to a
minimum. Students are not to be permitted to interrupt a class in session without authorization from the office
or teacher. Intercom use is restricted to administrative use or administrative approved use only.

## Classroom Security

When leaving the classroom, locker room, or other work areas between classes or at the end of the day,
teachers are required to turn out the lights and secure all doors and windows.

All staff is asked to refrain from keeping personal items of value in or about their room. Purses/bags should
never be left unsecured. Students should be instructed to leave valuables at home or secured at the office. The
district will not be responsible for the loss of or damage to personal property due to such causes as fire, theft,
accident, or vandalism.

## Communicable Disease/Bloodborne Pathogens/Infection Control Procedures
The district provides for the reasonable protection against the risk of exposure to communicable disease to all
staff while engaged in the performance of their duties. Protection is provided through immunization and
exclusion in accordance with Montana Code Annotated and the Administrative Rules of Montana. Infection
control procedures, including provisions for handling and disposing of contaminated fluids, have also been
established through Board policy 3417 and administrative regulations for staff and student protection.

All staff shall comply with measures adopted by the district and with all rules set by the Montana State Health
Department and the county health department.

## Complaints
### Student/Parent Complaints
The district recognizes that complaints regarding staff performance, discipline, grades, student progress, and
homework assignments will be made by students and parents from time to time. Every effort will be made to
ensure that such complaints are handled and resolved informally and as close to their origin as possible.
Students, parents, and others with complaints will be encouraged to discuss the complaint directly with the
staff member. All such meetings should be held in confidence and not in the presence of others.

If the complaint is not informally resolved, staff should advise the complainant that he/she may submit the
matter directly to the building principal or immediate supervisor, as appropriate. The complainant will be
provided with a copy of policy #1700 to follow for complaint procedure.

When a complaint is made directly to the Board as a whole or to an individual Board member, it will be referred
to the superintendent for appropriate building administrator follow-up.

All staff members should familiarize themselves with Board policy and applicable provisions of administrative
regulations and negotiated agreements regarding the handling of complaints.

### Staff Complaints
Staff member complaints contending a violation, misinterpretation, or inappropriate application of district
personnel policies and/or administrative regulations should be directed to the building principal or immediate
supervisor for informal discussion and resolution.


If the complaint is not resolved informally, formal complaint procedures may be initiated by staff in accordance
with Board Policy #5240, administrative regulations, and/or negotiated agreements as deemed appropriate.

Contracts and Compensation
Contracts for certified staff members will be initiated for all employees when hired. Classified staff members
are issued wage statements when hired.

Salaries and additional assignments are addressed in the negotiated agreement.

It is the staff member’s responsibility to provide all information necessary for placement on the salary schedule
to the office in accordance with timelines established by the district and negotiated agreements.

## Contests for Students

The district cooperates with individuals, community organizations, and agencies desiring to sponsor contests
for students, when such activities can be integrated into the school program without disruption or loss of
instructional time for the student and without imposing an unreasonable added workload on staff. All such
contests must be consistent with the purposes and educational aims of the district.

Teachers sponsoring such activities are responsible for the preparation and circulation of all informational
materials and for other administrative work required in the grading, judging or evaluation of the participants’
work.

The school may not be used to promote private or commercial interests, nor may the school be used for the
direct sales promotion of individual competitive goods or services.

## Copyright / Patents / Research

A variety of machines and equipment for reproducing materials to assist staff in carrying out their educational
assignments are available to staff in both the school and at home.

Infringement on copyrighted material, whether prose, poetry, graphic images, music, audio tape, video, or
computer-programmed materials, is a serious offense against federal law, a violation of Board policy #2312,
and contrary to ethical standards required of staff and students.

All reproduction of copyrighted material shall be conducted strictly in accordance with applicable provisions of
law. Unless otherwise allowed as “fair use” under federal law, permission must be acquired from the copyright
owner prior to reproduction of material in any form. Staff members are responsible for ensuring they comply
with federal copyright laws.

Staff members engaged in a research project during the work day or who use district resources or students,
either for study towards advanced work or for use in classroom instruction, may do so only with the prior
approval of the building principal.

Privacy rights of students or other individuals involved in such research projects must be maintained. Written
parental consent must be obtained and documentation of consent retained.

Publications, instructional materials, articles, models and other devices prepared by staff members for district
use with district time, money and facilities, as part of the employee’s job responsibilities, remain the property of
the district.


In the event that a staff member produces items described above partly on his/her own time and partly on
district time, the district reserves the right to claim full ownership. The employee may petition the district for
assignment of copyright or patent rights.

Employees may not attempt to copyright or patent such items without the knowledge and consent of the
district.

## Conferences

Planned conferences between teachers and parents/guardians are essential to the district’s efforts to further
understanding and close cooperation between the home and school. Parent/guardian-teacher conferences are
scheduled each year, and students may be included if the teacher or parent/guardian so desires.

Conferences should be treated as an opportunity for constructive, mutual exchange of information and ideas
for the welfare and continued academic growth of the student.

Occasionally, teachers or parents/guardians may arrange for conferences outside regularly scheduled
conference dates, to meet more immediate student needs. Teachers should be prepared to provide after
school or before school time to meet with students as necessary.

## Corporal Punishment & Physical Restraint

The use of corporal punishment in any form is strictly prohibited by the district and state law. Corporal
punishment is defined as the willful infliction of, or willfully causing the infliction of, physical pain.

A staff member is authorized to employ physical force when, in his/her professional judgement, the physical
force is necessary to prevent a student from harming himself/herself or others.

## Criminal Records Checks / Fingerprinting

Criminal background checks are required for all employees. Potential employees must pass a background
check to be eligible for employment in Laurel Public Schools.

## Curriculum

The curriculum established for the courses and grade levels of this district provides the flexibility necessary to
meet the individual needs of students and their divergent learning rates and styles.

Deviations from established curriculum, textbooks, and instructional materials are not permitted without
building principal and curriculum director’s approval. Teachers with questions should contact the building
principal and curriculum director.

Though teaching methodology may vary, classroom instruction is expected to reflect “best practices” consistent
with research on effective instruction.

## Custodial Rights

The district encourages parents to be involved in their student’s school experience. Teachers are advised that
unless otherwise ordered by the courts, an order of sole custody on the part of one parent does not deprive the
other parent of certain rights. It is the responsibility of the parent with sole custody to provide to the district any
court order that curtails the rights of the non-custodial parent.


A non-custodial parent may receive and inspect the school records pertaining to their student and to consult
with teachers concerning their student’s welfare and education.

Non-custodial parents will not be granted visitation or telephone access to their student during the school day.
Students may not be released to the non-custodial parent without the written permission of the parent having
sole custody.

In the case of joint custody, it is the responsibility of the parents to provide the district, in writing, any special
requests or clarifications in areas concerning the student and the district’s relationship and responsibilities.
Such information will be maintained on file in the office and provided to staff as appropriate.

Staff members with questions regarding custodial and/or non-custodial parent rights with respect to particular
students should refer to Board Policy 3600 and contact the building principal.

## Discipline and Discharge

Discipline and dismissal of staff will follow due process, administrative regulation, relevant provisions of
negotiated agreements and applicable law.

## Dismissal of Classes

Teachers should never dismiss a class before the established dismissal time. Detaining the entire class after
dismissal time is also discouraged. Whenever individual students are detained after class, the teacher is
expected to provide the student a note/pass for the student’s next class teacher. This will help reduce
unnecessary hall traffic, as students reporting to class late will need to account for their tardiness.

## Drug Free Workplace

No staff member engaged in work in connection with a direct federal grant of contract shall unlawfully
manufacture, distribute, dispense, possess, or use on or in the workplace, any narcotic drug, hallucinogenic
drug, amphetamine, barbiturate, marijuana, or any other controlled substance or alcohol, as defined in
schedules I through V of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and as further defined
by regulation at 21 CFR 1300.11 through 1300.15. Laurel Public Schools Policy #5226 relates to Drug Free
Workplace.

“Workplace” is defined to mean the site for the performance of work done in connection with a federal grant or
contract. That includes any school building or any school premises: any school-owned vehicle, or any other
school-approved vehicle used to transport students to and from school or school activities; off school property
during any school-sponsored or school-approved activity, event, or function, such as a field trip or athletic
event, where students are under the jurisdiction of the school district where work on a federal grant is
performed.

Each staff member engaged in work related to a district federal grant or contract must notify his/her supervisor
of his/her conviction of any criminal drug statute based on conduct occurring in the workplace, as defined
above, no later than five days after such conviction.

## Employee Wellness Program / Insurance

The district provides various insurance options for employees. The selection of this insurance is done through
committee work between the District, their insurance consultant and the local bargaining units with final
approval by the Board of Trustees.


The district employs a wellness coordinator to provide the staff with activities to promote health and fitness to
its employees. See the appendix (Employee Wellness Program) of this document for contact information.

## Evaluation of Staff

Copies of the district’s evaluation procedures will be provided to all staff. Evaluation of all staff will be
conducted in accordance with established Board policy and applicable district evaluation procedures,
negotiated agreements, and Montana Code Annotated.

## Fair Labor Standards Act

Regular working hours for all classified staff will be set by the district. Classified staff are not to work before,
beyond, or outside their established working hours and are not to work overtime without prior authorization
from their supervisor.

All-time records must be a true reflection of all time worked, whether it is more or less than regularly scheduled
work hours.

Failure to comply will result in disciplinary action in accordance with applicable provisions of Board policy,
administrative regulations, and negotiated agreements.

Administrators, directors, and/or supervisors shall give written notification to non-exempt employees, as
defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act, of the Board’s expectations as listed above.

Overtime is defined as time worked over 40 hours in one week. The week is defined as seven consecutive
days covering Saturday through Friday.

## Feature Films/Videos

Building principal approval is required prior to showing a feature film/video to students in district classrooms.

The following information should be included in the request to the building administrator:

1. Title and brief description;
2. Purpose for the showing;
3. Match with course objectives and state standards;
4. Proposed date of showing:
5. When and how parents will be notified, or if necessary grant consent;
6. Audience rating.

The showing of all feature films/videos with a G rating requires prior parent notification from the staff member.
Feature films/videos with a PG or PG-13 rating must have prior parental consent. All other videos are not
allowed.

## Field Trips and Special Events

Field trips and other student activities involving travel may be authorized by the building principal, when such
trips or activities contribute to the achievement of desirable educational goals.

Requests should be submitted to the building principal well in advance of the proposed activity. All such
requests will be considered, based on such factors as availability of funds, the educational value derived, the


safety and welfare of the students involved, impact on the regular school program, and availability of
appropriate supervision, either from within school staff or from volunteers.

In district trips (from school to school) do not require parent permission. The teacher/school will notify parents
and guardians of such trips. Written parental permission must be obtained for travel outside of the district
boundaries. Teachers are expected to submit the signed forms showing parental approval and
acknowledgement of the student conduct guidelines, to the office prior to departure for the scheduled activity.

Staff members should contact the office for appropriate substitute and vehicle arrangements and related field
trip procedures and forms. Staff members also must submit to the transportation department, well in advance,
the specifics of the field trip. A field trip / transportation form is located at your building office. All staff need to
follow guidelines for securing a substitute if needed.

## Fundraising / Crowdsourcing /Student Activity Funds

Activities to raise money for a wide variety of school activities and equipment are held at various times
throughout the course of the school year. All fund-raising activities must be conducted under the direct
supervision of staff or other authorized individuals and approved by the principal and superintendent prior to
the activity being initiated. Fundraising requests must include an explanation or justification for the proposal,
consistent with building and/or district goals. Fundraising must not interfere with or disrupt the school
environment. Fundraising request form can be found in the appendix (Fundraiser Request Form) of this
document.

Crowdfunding requests are governed and supervised by board policy 7225. Proposals must receive prior
approval from the Superintendent or designee using form 7225F. Crowdfunding requests must include an
explanation or justification for the proposal, consistent with building and/or district goals.

All expenditures from the general account of student activity funds must also be approved by the school-
recognized student government organization if such organization exists. Funds derived from the student body
as a whole shall be expended to benefit the student body as a whole.

All moneys raised or collected by and/or for school-approved student groups are to be receipted and deposited
into an account administered by the business office. Staff should never keep money or checks in their
classroom and should store in the school safe at the end of the school day. All student activity fund
expenditures must be approved by the building principal, the student leader, and the activity supervisor of the
student activities program.

Gifts and Solicitations
Staff members are to avoid accepting anything of value offered by another for the purpose of influencing
his/her professional judgement. No organization may solicit funds from staff members within the schools, nor
may anyone distribute flyers or other materials related to fund drives through the school without the building
principal’s approval.

The solicitation of staff by sales people, other staff, or agents during on-duty hours is prohibited. Any
solicitation should be reported at once to the building principal.

## Grading / Progress Reports / Report Cards

The evaluation of student progress is primary responsibility of all teachers. The highest possible level of
student achievement is a common goal of both the district and the home. As a close working relationship


between the district and the home is essential to the accomplishment of this goal, regular communications
(phone calls, emails, Infinite Campus messenger) and updated grades (posted on a regular basis) with parents
is essential and required. No grade of a “D” or “F” should be issued without a written comment with
explanation and reasons for grade. Grade requirements need to be updated and posted on a regular basis in
the selected grading software. Grades should be updated weekly (or more often).

Teachers should use a variety of communication devices, including phone, personal conferences, written
grade reports and emails to keep parents well informed of positive issues as well as areas of improvement At
the beginning of the grading period, students and parents are to be informed regarding the basis of the grades
and the methods to be used in determining grades.

Progress / report cards will be issued on a quarterly basis but can also be issued at midway point of each
quarter (Midterms). Such reports may be issued at other times during the course of a grading period as
deemed appropriate by teachers and administrators.

## Grievances

Refer to applicable provisions of certified and/or classified negotiated agreements, or board policy, as
appropriate.

## Guest Speakers

Guest speakers may be used by teachers from time to time, when such use is consistent with educational
goals and with a demonstrable relation to the curricular or co-curricular activity in which the participating
students are involved. Teachers are expected to obtain prior written approval from the building principal for the
date, time and nature of the presentation whenever such use is planned. See appendix for the form for
requesting a guest speaker. (Guest Speaker Request Form)

(Homework) Practice for Learning
Teachers at all grade levels are encouraged to consistently assign practice for learning based on specific
standards, which is expected to increase in complexity with the maturity or grade level of the student.

Practice may refer to an assignment prepared during a period of supervised study in class or outside of class
or which requires individual work in the home.

All work is expected to be designed to improve learning, to aid in the mastery of skills or standards.

The information for any assignment should be clear and specific so that the student can complete the
assignment. Work should not require the use of reference materials not readily available in most homes,
school libraries, or the public library. Practice should require the use of those materials only when the student
has had instruction in such use.

## Internships

The district supports expanding professional advancement. The district will work with teachers to schedule
internship hours through use of discretionary leave, prep time, and before or after instructional hours. These
hours will be mutually agreed upon by administrator and intern.

## Inventory

The district requires teachers to do inventories each year (e.g. curriculum, textbooks, technology items,
furniture).

## Keys/Fobs

Keys and Fobs are issued to staff by the building principal or supervisor. In order to protect property, students,
and staff and to ensure the building is adequately secured when no authorized personnel are present, all staff
are expected to follow the key-control procedures:


1. Duplication of keys is prohibited;
2. Keys/Fobs are not to be left unattended. Avoid having keys on desks, tables, mailboxes, unattended
    coats, etc.;

    employee; See appendix for replacement costs (Keys/Fobs).
5. All keys/fobs will be inventoried at the end of each school year.

## Lesson Plans

The quality of the instructional program reflects the effort invested by teachers in developing lesson plans
consistent with standards and district curriculum and appropriate to the individual needs of students.

Teachers are expected to prepare lesson plans on a weekly basis. Lesson plans are to be kept by teachers in
a place known to and accessible to the building principal. Teachers may be required to provide copies of
lesson plans to the office at reasonable times and intervals, as determined by the building principal.

Lesson plans should be of sufficient length and substance to allow a substitute teacher to carry on the course
of study and to provide a means by which the building principal may monitor instruction to assure that the
educational program in a particular class or activity is consistent with the district-approved course of study.

An up-to-date substitute folder should be located with lesson plans. This folder should contain, but not limited
to, seating charts, class schedules, evacuation routes, other important procedures, and information identifying
any classroom student aides or other special student needs.

General plans which cover the length of the course of study should also be prepared and readily available for
building principal and/or student and parent review.

Make-Up work
All students are expected to make up all work without exceptions. In the case of any absence, students will
have sufficient time to complete work upon their return. Follow the guidelines set forth in the student
handbooks.

## Materials Distribution

Requests of staff by individuals or groups to distribute pamphlets, booklets, flyers, brochures, and other similar
materials to students for classroom use or to take home are to be referred to the building principal. The
materials and proposed method of distribution will be reviewed and a decision made based on the educational
concerns and interests of the district.

## Media Access to Students

The media may interview and photograph students involved in instructional programs and other school
activities, including athletic events. Such media access may not be unduly disruptive and must comply with
Board policies and district goals.


Media representatives are required to report to the building principal for prior approval before accessing
students involved in instructional programs and activities not attended by the general public.

Information obtained by media representatives directly from students does not require parental approval prior
to publication by the media. Parents who do not want their student interviewed or photographed by the media
may direct their student accordingly. All teachers are required to know which students in their classrooms do
not have media release signatures and should direct media from interviewing or photographing those students.

Staff may release student information to the media only in accordance with applicable provisions of the
education records law and Board policies governing directory information and personally identifiable
information. Reference Board Policy 3600.

## Meetings

Staff meetings are scheduled for the purpose of organization and communication of business that typically
cannot be handled through staff bulletins, emails, all calls, departmental or committee structure. All staff are
required to attend staff meetings unless prior arrangements have been made with the building principal or
immediate supervisor.

Meetings sponsored or called by recognized collective bargaining units during contract hours are subject to
prior approval of the building principal and in accordance with district policy. Attendance of staff members at
such meetings is left to the discretion of each employee.

## Moving Class/Holding Classes Outdoors

From time to time, teachers may find it necessary to temporarily move a class from their scheduled room or
teaching area. Teachers are responsible for ensuring that both the office and students are informed of the
change.

From time to time, certain class assignments may be more appropriately conducted outdoors. Teachers must
notify the office before moving class outdoors in case of emergency or in the case of the teacher or a student is
needed.

## Participation in Political Activities

Staff members may exercise their right to participate fully in affairs of public interest on a local, county, state,
and national level, on the same basis as any citizen in public or private employment and within the law.

Staff members may, within the limitations imposed by the state and federal laws and regulations, choose any
side of a particular issue and support their viewpoints as they desire, by vote, discussion, or persuading others.
Such discussion and persuasion, however, may not be carried on during the performance of district duties.

On all controversial issues, staff members are expected to make clear that the viewpoints they represent are
personal and are not to be interpreted as the district’s official viewpoint.

## Personnel Records

An official personnel file is established for each person employed by the district. A staff member’s personnel
file may contain such information as applications for employment, references, records relative to
compensation, payroll deductions, evaluations, complaints, and documented disciplinary actions.


All records containing medical-condition information, such as worker’s compensation reports and
release/permission to return to work forms, will be kept confidential, in a separate file from personnel records.

All personnel records are considered confidential and not open to public inspection. Access to personnel files
is limited to use and inspection only by the following or as otherwise required by law:

1. The individual employee. An employee or designee may arrange with the personnel office to inspect
    the contents of his/her personnel file on any day the personnel office is open for business;
2. Others designated in writing by the employee;
3. The comptroller or auditor, when such inspection is pertinent to carrying out their respective duties, or
    as otherwise specifically authorized by the Board. Information so obtained will be kept confidential. No
    files will be removed from their central location for personal inspection;
4. A Board member, when specifically authorized by the Board. Information will be kept confidential. No
    files will be removed from their central location for personal inspection;
5. The superintendent and members of the central administrative staff;
6. District administrators and supervisors who currently or prospectively supervise the employee;
7. Attorneys for the district or the district’s designated representative on matters of the district business.
In accordance with federal law, the district is required to release information regarding the professional
qualifications and degrees of teachers and the qualifications of aides/paraprofessionals to parents upon
request, for any teacher or aide/paraprofessional who is employed by a school receiving Title I funds, and who
provides instruction to their child.

Release of personnel records to parties other than those authorized to inspect them will be only upon receipt of
a court order.

## Prep Periods/Instructional Staff Planning Time

All prep time will be in accordance with the Negotiated Agreement.

## Purchase Orders

No obligation may be incurred by any staff member, unless that expenditure has been authorized in the budget
or as may otherwise be permitted by Board action and/or Board policy. Purchase orders are required for the
purchase of goods and services unless requirements of the p-card program are met.

No purchase, including purchases from student body funds, will be authorized unless covered by an approved
purchase order. All purchases must be approved by the building administrator and district office.

## Receipts and Personal Reimbursements

Personal reimbursements for district purchases are strongly discouraged. In the rare event that a personal
reimbursement must be made the request for reimbursement for approved purchases may be authorized only
upon submission of appropriate receipts to the business manager. Requests must be submitted within 10 days
of the purchase, or approval for the reimbursement will be denied.

## Release of General Staff Information

A staff member’s address and personal phone number will not be released by the district. Such information
may be disclosed if a staff member authorizes the district to do so.

The district may also disclose information about a former employee’s job performance to a prospective
employer, under the following conditions:


1. Disclosure of information is upon the request of the prospective employer; or
2. Disclosure of information is upon the request of the former staff member;
3. The information is related to job performance;
4. The disclosure is presumed to be in good faith.

The district will not disclose information that is knowingly false, deliberately misleading, rendered with
malicious purpose, or is in violation of the staff member’s civil rights.

## Release Time for Religious Instruction

Students may be excused from school for religious instruction, in accordance with board policy. Teachers will
be notified by the office of any students in their class so excused.

Any student unable to attend classes on a particular day, due to beliefs, is to be excused from attendance
requirements for that day.

No such absences shall be counted against a student in determining failure or reduction of grades. Any tests
and assignments a student misses because of such absences are to be given to the student upon his/her
return to school or at such other times as may be deemed appropriate by the teacher. (Policy 2334)

## Resignation of Staff

Certified and classified personnel will generally be expected to fulfill the terms of their contract and/or job
description unless there are clearly compelling, mitigating circumstances which prevent the certified or exempt
individual from doing so.

The Board has authorized the Superintendent to accept on its behalf resignations from any school district
employee. The Superintendent shall provide written acceptance of the resignation, including the date of
acceptance, to the employee, setting for the effective date of the resignation. The resignee will also be asked
to fill out appropriate paperwork with the district office, including, but not limited to, the exit interview.

Once the Superintendent has accepted the resignation, it may not be withdrawn by the employee. The
resignation and its acceptance will be reported as information to the Board at the next regular meeting.

## Resuscitation

No staff member may comply with any directive from parents or others, written or verbal, that life-sustaining
emergency care be withheld from a student in need of such care while under the control and supervision of
district staff.

Life-sustaining emergency care means any procedure or intervention applied by appropriately trained district
staff that may prevent a student from dying who, without such procedure or intervention, faces a risk of
imminent death. Examples of life-sustaining emergency care may include: efforts to stop bleeding, unblocking
airways, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

In a life-threatening situation, staff members are expected to dial 911 for paramedic assistance and provide
life-sustaining emergency care to any student requiring it in order to sustain life, until relieved by paramedics or
other appropriate medical personnel.


## Retirement

To assist the district in its planning efforts, staff members considering retirement are encouraged to notify the
district as early as possible, preferably at the beginning of the school year in which the retirement will take
place. The district will follow all dates as listed in negotiated agreement for certified staff. Contact information
can be found in the appendix of this document (Retirement - Contact).

## Safety

Disaster Drills
There will be at least eight (8) disaster drills a year consisting of fire, evacuation, shelter in place, etc. All
teachers will discuss safety drill procedures with their class at the beginning of the year. The drills will be held
at different hours of the day or evening to avoid distinction between drills and actual disasters. Use of safety
charts and school procedures during all events is required. It is the job of the teacher or staff member to report
any issues during a drill to the building principal or safety leader.

A map/diagram of the fire escape route to be followed must be posted near the classroom doorways and
reviewed with students. Upon the sounding of a fire alarm, teachers are required to follow school procedures.
School personnel must fill out a safety drill form at the completion of any event including drills or real events.
Forms are located with the building principal or secretary.

Emergency Closures
In the event of hazardous or emergency conditions, all district schools or selected schools or grade levels may
be closed or schedules altered to provide delayed openings of school and/or early dismissal of students as
appropriate.

The all call system will be utilized in the event of such closures. Also, the local radio stations will be notified to
announce any delays or cancellations. The district website along with district social media will scroll important
emergency closure information. The district will also utilize the automated phone messaging system with up to
date announcements.

The Superintendent in consultation with the building administration will make final decisions on all school
closures.

Emergency Procedures and Disaster Plans
All staff will be provided with a copy of the school’s emergency procedures flip chart detailing staff
responsibilities in the event of emergencies. Administration will ensure that all emergency procedures are
followed and necessary paperwork is completed.

Copies of the emergency procedures flip charts will be located in every room of the school. This includes
classrooms, offices, janitor rooms, boiler rooms, district administration, etc. Staff are expected to familiarize
themselves with evacuation procedures and participate in required drills and emergency/safety training.

Safety Committee
Each building safety committee helps implement the district’s safety program and as a part of an ongoing effort
to help ensure the safety and health of students, staff, and others while on district property.

The building safety committee will meet twice per year. The building administrator and facilities director will
conduct a safety walk through at least once per year and make recommendations for corrections as needed.
All significant safety related incidents are investigated to help prevent similar events from reoccurring. The


District will hold two safety meetings to discuss issues at each building, as well as form policies and
procedures that are consistent across the district.

All potential hazards are to be reported immediately to the building principal or immediate supervisor.

Staff Health and Safety
In order to assure the safety of staff and students, information and/or training, as necessary, is provided to
assist all staff to recognize and to respond appropriately to the presence of hazardous materials in the
workplace, including proper handling, labeling, storage, and disposal of such materials.

All staff members are expected to conduct their work in compliance with first aid and infection control
procedures established by the district and the following safety rules of the district. All injuries must be reported
to your immediate supervisor. Safety rules can be found in the appendix (Staff Health and Safety). An accident
form must be filled out within the first 48 hours. An accident form can be found in the appendix. Injury Report
for Staff Member

Special Interest Materials
Supplementary materials from non-school sources require building principal approval prior to their use in
school. This includes educational films and all video rentals secured from or through commercial sources.

Generally, materials that are of obvious educational quality, supplement and enrich instructional and reference
materials for definite school courses, and are timely may be considered for approval.

## Staff Conduct

Employees are expected to maintain high standards of honesty, integrity and impartiality in the conduct of
district business.

In accordance with state law, an employee should not dispense or utilize any information gained from
employment with the district, accept gifts or benefits, or participate in business enterprises or employment
which created a conflict of interest with the faithful and impartial discharge of the employee’s district duties. A
district employee may, prior to acting in a manner which may impinge on any fiduciary duty, disclose the nature
of the private interest which creates a conflict. Care should be taken to avoid using, or avoid the appearance of
using, official positions and confidential information for personal advantage or gain.

Further, employees should hold confidential all information deemed to be not for public consumption as
determined by state law and Board policy. Employees shall also respect the confidentiality of people served in
the course of the employee’s duties and use information gained in a reasonable manner. Discretion should be
employed even within the school system’s own network of communication.

Professionalism is expected at work when in public areas. All employees must refrain from using inappropriate
language, comments, or gestures. (ie: confidentiality to student records, etc...)

## Staff Development

The Board recognizes the importance of continued educational experiences and other professional growth
activities as a means to improve job performance.

Professional growth experiences may include, but are not limited to, college courses, workshops, curriculum
planning, individual research, travel, supervision of teacher trainees, and other such activities.


All requests for release time from regular work duties for attendance at meetings or conferences will be
decided based on such factors as availability of funds, consistency with district and building goals and job
assignment. Requests require prior building principal approval.

Meetings and conferences devoted primarily or exclusively to organizational affairs or staff members collective
bargaining units, political workshops, training sessions for consultation committees, and like activities will not
be considered as appropriate activities for the expenditure of district funds.

## Staff Dress and Grooming

All staff are expected to be neat, clean, and to wear appropriate dress for work that is in good taste and
suitable for the job at hand.

Education as a profession demands setting a good example for students in every possible way. As adults and
professionals, all staff are expected to be guided in their grooming habits by what is most generally acceptable
in the business and professional world.

## Staff Room

A staff room is provided for staff use during break, lunch, and preparation periods as may be appropriate. All
staff are expected to help keep this gathering area clean and orderly. This includes helping with dishes,
cleaning of microwaves, counters and the refrigerator.

Personal items of value should not be left in the staff room. Staff members leaving such items in the staff room
do so at their own risk.

Students are not permitted in the staff room.

## Student Conduct

All students are to comply with district policy, written building and classroom rules, pursue the prescribed
course of study, submit to the lawful authority of teachers and school officials, and conduct themselves in an
orderly manner at school, during the school day or during school-sponsored activities.

In addition to adopted Board policies governing student conduct, administrative regulations specifying student-
conduct expectations have been established. These rules apply to actions which occur on district property, at
any district-sponsored activity regardless of location: or when traveling to or from school for district-sponsored
activities. Disregard of these rules constitutes grounds for suspension, expulsion, or other reasonable
disciplinary action.

All teachers are expected to review the student conduct rules contained in the Student/Parent Handbook with
their students during the first week of the school year.

Student conduct rules unique to individual classrooms may also be developed by teachers. All such rules must
be consistent with district policy and local building administrative regulations governing student conduct and
discipline. Classroom rules and consequences are to be reviewed with students, posted in classrooms, and
made available to parents.


## Student Detention

Teachers may detain a student after school hours for disciplinary reasons, provided the parent has been
notified of the detention and, in the case of bus students, prior arrangements have been made for the student’s
transportation home.

Parents may be asked to arrange for the transportation of the detained student; however, if the parent cannot
or will not provide it, an alternative disciplinary procedure may be considered.

Students who are detained after school are not to be left unsupervised during their detention.

## Student/Parent Handbook

A student/parent handbook is available to all students at the beginning of each new school year and at the time
of registration for new students moving into the district at other times of the year. Paper copies are available at
all school offices and a copy can be found on the Laurel Website. Sign off sheets will be collected to verify
receipt.

All staff are expected to familiarize themselves with the general information, administrative rules and
procedures pertaining to students, as set forth in the student/parent handbook and in Board policy.

Teachers are expected to review the handbook with students during the days/times designated by the building
principal.

## Student Promotion

Students will normally progress annually from grade to grade. Exceptions may be made when, in the judgment
of the professional staff, such as exceptions are in the best educational interest of the students involved. All
student retentions must follow Policy 2421.

## Student Transportation in Private Vehicles

Transportation of students to and from school and to curricular and extracurricular activities sponsored by the
district is provided by the district’s transportation system in accordance with district policy.

No student is to be permitted to perform district business with his/her own vehicle, a staff member’s vehicle, or
a district owned vehicle.

## Student Withdrawal from School

Upon notification by the office of a student withdrawal from school, teachers are expected to complete the
student withdrawal form, including grade earned to date.

Teachers are expected to make a complete accounting of any unreturned or damaged books, locks, materials,
supplies, equipment, or other district property, including replacement costs, if known. This list must be
submitted to the office.

## Supervision of Students

Staff members are responsible for the supervision of all students while in school or engaged in school-
sponsored activities.

All teachers are expected to be in their classrooms, hallways, or other assigned duty areas prior to the arrival
of students. Under no circumstances are classrooms or other areas where students are under the supervision


of assigned staff to be left unattended while students are present. Teachers who may need to temporarily
leave the classroom or their assigned duties in an emergency situation while students are present are
expected to contact the office to arrange for temporary coverage.

No other staff member may leave their assigned group unsupervised except as appropriate supervision
arrangements have been made to take care of an emergency.

During school hours or while engaged in school-sponsored activities, students may be released only into the
custody of parents or other authorized persons.

## Teaching about Religion

Religious education is the responsibility of the home and religious institutions. Public schools are obligated to
maintain neutrality in all such matters. However, as religion influences many areas of education, such as
literature and history, its role in civilization may be taught when consistent with curriculum and teaching
assignment. In such instances, teachers may provide information and opportunity for students to explore
various religions. Teachers may not advocate, openly or covertly or by subtlety, a particular religion or
religious belief.

## Telephones/Cell phones

Telephones are available throughout the building for staff convenience. Long-distance calls may be placed for
district business. District phones are not to be used for personal long-distance calls. Cell phones must be used
in accordance with RUP and should not be used when instructing students (unless phone is used as a
teaching tool).

## Tobacco-Free Environment

The District maintains tobacco-free buildings and grounds. Tobacco includes but is not limited to cigarettes,
cigars, snuff, smoking tobacco, smokeless tobacco and vaping.

Use of tobacco products in a public school building or on public school property is prohibited, unless the use of
a tobacco product in a classroom or on other school property as part of a lecture, demonstration, or
educational forum sanctioned by a school administrator or faculty member, concerning the risks associated
with using tobacco products.

For this purpose, “public school building or public school property” means:
● Public land, fixtures, buildings, or other property owned or occupied by an institution for the
teaching of minor children that is established and maintained under the laws of the state of
Montana at public expense: and
● Includes playgrounds, school steps, parking lots, administration buildings, athletic facilities,
gymnasiums, locker rooms, and school buses.

## Use of Private Vehicles for District Business

The use of private vehicles for district business, including the transportation of students, is generally
discouraged. Staff members should use district-owned vehicles whenever possible, scheduling activities and
other transportation far enough in advance to avoid any non-emergency use of private vehicles. No staff
members may use a private vehicle for district business without written permission from the building principal.

## Vacancies / Transfers

All vacancies for any job within the district will be filled in accordance with the negotiated agreements.


Voluntary and involuntary transfer of staff members may be authorized by the superintendent based on district
personnel needs and in accordance with district procedures and negotiated agreements.

## Visitors

Students are not permitted to bring visitors to school without prior approval of the building principal.

Staff members are expected to report any unauthorized person on school property to the front office and
building principal immediately. Guests are to check in at the front office and will be provided with an ID badge.
