# Model Notification of Rights Under the Protection of Pupil Rights

# Amendment (PPRA)

PPRA affords parents of elementary and secondary students certain rights regarding the conduct of
surveys, collection and use of information for marketing purposes, and certain physical exams. These
include, but are not limited to, the right to:

## _Consent_ before students are required to submit to a survey that concerns one or more of the following
protected areas (“protected information survey”) if the survey is funded in whole or in part by a program
of the U.S. Department of Education (ED)–

1. Political affiliations or beliefs of the student or student’s parent;
2. Mental or psychological problems of the student or student’s family;
3. Sex behavior or attitudes;
4. Illegal, anti-social, self-incriminating, or demeaning behavior;
5. Critical appraisals of others with whom respondents have close family relationships;
6. Legally recognized privileged relationships, such as with lawyers, doctors, or ministers;
7. Religious practices, affiliations, or beliefs of the student or student’s parent; or
8. Income, other than as required by law to determine program eligibility.

## _Receive notice and an opportunity to opt a student out of_ –

1. Any other protected information survey, regardless of funding;
2. Any non-emergency, invasive physical exam or screening required as a condition of
    attendance, administered by the school or its agent, and not necessary to protect the immediate
    health and safety of a student, except for hearing, vision, or scoliosis screenings, or any
    physical exam or screening permitted or required under State law; and
3. Activities involving collection, disclosure, or use of personal information collected from
    students for marketing or to sell or otherwise distribute the information to others. (This does
    not apply to the collection, disclosure, or use of personal information collected from students
    for the exclusive purpose of developing, evaluating, or providing educational products or
    services for, or to, students or educational institutions.)

## _Inspect_ , upon request and before administration or use –

1. Protected information surveys of students and surveys created by a third party;
2. Instruments used to collect personal information from students for any of the above marketing,
    sales, or other distribution purposes; and
3. Instructional material used as part of the educational curriculum.

These rights transfer from the parents to a student who is 18 years old or an emancipated minor under
State law.

**[School District will/has develop[ed] and adopt[ed]]** policies, in consultation with parents, regarding
these rights, as well as arrangements to protect student privacy in the administration of protected
information surveys and the collection, disclosure, or use of personal information for marketing, sales, or
other distribution purposes. **[School District]** will directly notify parents of these policies at least
annually at the start of each school year and after any substantive changes. **[School District]** will also
directly notify, such as through U.S. Mail or email, parents of students who are scheduled to participate in
the specific activities or surveys noted below and will provide an opportunity for the parent to opt his or
her child out of participation of the specific activity or survey. **[School District]** will make this
notification to parents at the beginning of the school year if the District has identified the specific or
approximate dates of the activities or surveys at that time. For surveys and activities scheduled after the
school year starts, parents will be provided reasonable notification of the planned activities and surveys
listed below and be provided an opportunity to opt their child out of such activities and surveys. Parents
will also be provided an opportunity to review any pertinent surveys. Following is a list of the specific
activities and surveys covered under this direct notification requirement:

- Collection, disclosure, or use of personal information collected from students for marketing,
sales, or other distribution.
- Administration of any protected information survey not funded in whole or in part by ED.
- Any non-emergency, invasive physical examination or screening as described above.
