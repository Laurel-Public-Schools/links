## PPRA Model Notice and Consent/Opt-Out for Specific Activities 
*LEAs should adopt the following model form as appropriate*

---

The Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA), 20 U.S.C. § 1232h, requires [School
District] to notify you and obtain consent or allow you to opt your child out of participating in
certain school activities. These activities include a student survey, analysis, or evaluation that
concerns one or more of the following eight areas (“protected information surveys”):

1. Political affiliations or beliefs of the student or student’s parent;
2. Mental or psychological problems of the student or student’s family;
3. Sex behavior or attitudes;
4. Illegal, anti-social, self-incriminating, or demeaning behavior;
5. Critical appraisals of others with whom respondents have close family relationships;
6. Legally recognized privileged relationships, such as with lawyers, doctors, or
ministers;
7. Religious practices, affiliations, or beliefs of the student or parents; or
8. Income, other than as required by law to determine program eligibility.

This requirement also applies to the collection, disclosure or use of student information for
marketing purposes (“marketing surveys”), and certain physical exams and screenings.

Following is a schedule of activities requiring parental notice and consent or opt-out for the
upcoming school year. This list is not exhaustive and, for surveys and activities scheduled after
the school year starts, the [School District] will provide parents, within a reasonable period of
time prior to the administration of the surveys and activities, notification of the surveys and
activities and be provided an opportunity to opt their child out, as well as an opportunity to
review the surveys. (Please note that this notice and consent/opt-out transfers from parents to
any student who is 18 years old or an emancipated minor under State law.)

the attached consent form no later than [insert return **Date**] so that your child may participate in

**Date**: November 22 - 24, 2012

**Grades**: One through Six

**Activity**: Flu Shots

influenza types A and B.

Opt-out: Contact [school official] at [telephone number, email, address, etc.] no later than
[**Date**] if you do not want your child to participate in this **Activity**.

Below are two examples dealing with the collection, use and distribution of personal
information for student-based commercial services. Administrators should particularly note
the difference in the type of consent required for each **Activity** depending on what personal
information is being collected, used or distributed.

[Survey A: Limited to personal information designated as “directory information”]

**Date**: 2011-2012 School Year

**Grades**: Nine through Twelve

**Activity**: Student-Based Commercial Services

Summary: [School] collects, or allows businesses to collect, use, and disclose personal
information on students, including names, addresses, and telephone listings. These businesses
provide student-based products and services, such as computer equipment, sports clothing,
school jewelry, and entertainment products.

Opt-out: Contact [school official] at [telephone number, email, address, etc.] no later than
[**Date**] if you do not want your child to participate in this **Activity**.

[Note to schools: This information – names, addresses, and telephone listings – may be
designated and disclosed as “directory information” under the Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act (FERPA). Instead of using this Model Notice format, schools may meet
PPRA notice requirements for specific marketing activities that involve only designated
“directory information” by allowing parents to opt of “directory information” at the start
of each school year, which would include all marketing activities.]

[Survey B: Collects personal information beyond designated directory information]

**Date**: 2011-2012 School Year

**Grades**: Nine through Twelve

**Activity**: Student-Based Commercial Services

Summary: [School] collects, or allows businesses to collect, use, and disclose personal
information on students, including names, addresses, telephone listings and social security


numbers. These businesses provide student-based products and services, such as computer
equipment, sports clothing, school jewelry, and entertainment products.

Consent: A parent must sign and return the attached consent form no later than [insert return
**Date**] so that your child may participate in this **Activity**.

[Note to schools: While some of the information – names, addresses, and telephone listings

- may be designated and disclosed as “directory information” under the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), schools that permit marketing activities that
involve the collection, use, and disclosure of students’ social security numbers may not use
an opt-out procedure and must obtain prior written consent in accordance with § 99.30 of
the FERPA regulations.]

If you wish to review any survey instrument or instructional material used in connection with
any protected information or marketing survey, please submit a request to [school official,
address]. [School official] will notify you of the time and place where you may review these
materials. You have the right to review a survey and/or instructional materials before the survey
is administered to a student.
